The other side of <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/01/how-do-you-make-flex-application.html">that one project</a> that I'm working on for PhotoCity.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/articles/flex_php_charting.html">Apparently PHP and Flex can work pretty well together</a>, but all I'm interested in now is how a PHP page can send back data to a Flex application to work with.  In particular, all I want to do for now is for Flex to take a simple line of data (the x, y, and z coordinates of a point) that PHP returns to it.<br /><br />The main issue with sending data from PHP to Flex is how to structure the data.  One way that PHP can communicate data back to Flex is by <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/articles/flashbuilder4_php_part1.html">formatting output in XML, which Flex can then read and put into pretty charts</a>, but I don't want to worry too much about formatting in XML yet.<br /><br />Looking around, I found that the <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend Framework</a> is another amazing way that you can make an application with a Flex front-end and a PHP(5) back-end, with which you can <a href="http://blog.videgro.net/2011/02/adobe-flex-with-a-php-back-end/">easily return a database table through PHP to Flex in an array</a>.  But this still seems a little bit more than the simple functionality I want.<br /><br />Something else promising: using Flex's <code>RemoteObject</code> class, which can be used by a Flex application as if it were a remote PHP class.  (Remember <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/01/remote-procedure-calls-rpc.html">remote procedure calls</a>?!)  Just like other UI components in Flex, you can make a <Code><a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/mx/rpc/remoting/mxml/RemoteObject.html">RemoteObject</a></code> components, which will represent an HTTPService object, and allow you to access specific functions of a remote object.  For instance, if you define a class <code>data</code> in PHP, with a function <code>getData</code>, in Flex you could call <code>data.getData</code>, and that will be like calling the function <code>getData</code>.<br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-E_zcb_nDd-g/TWgglG0C8PI/AAAAAAAAAI0/S8u4G8uLa0Q/s1600/fig3_3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="196" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-E_zcb_nDd-g/TWgglG0C8PI/AAAAAAAAAI0/S8u4G8uLa0Q/s320/fig3_3.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="http://php.dzone.com/news/architecture-flex-php">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />However, PHP doesn't support remoting natively, you you'd need a server-side library to enable it: thus, Zend again (which is Adobe's recommendation), or AMFPHP, etc.  (You can use RemoteObject to call methods directly on a ColdFusion component or a Java class.)<br /><br />Additionally, you could facilitate communication between Flex and PHP by <a href="http://ria.dzone.com/articles/php-and-flex-sockets">using PHP as a socket server and connecting to it with a Flex application</a>.  The advantage of using sockets to send data from a server to a client is that, unlike with the HTTP client/server communication model, which needs a lot of exta information (i.e. to support how the client sends a request to server, then server processes the request, then client receives a response and disconnects), with a socket, the application makes a single request, and the server opens a connection and maintains it so that it can push data out to the client whenever it feels like it.  This also seems kind of complicated, as Flash Player requires policy files to be on the server the client is connecting to, and then you need a socket object...<br /><br /><br /><br />Sources:<br />Adobe Developer Connection: <a h="" href="" ref="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/articles/flex_php_charting.html">Flex and PHP charting</a>, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/articles/flashbuilder4_php_part1.html">Flash Builder 4 and PHP -- Part 1: Data-centric development</a><br />Adobe: <A href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/mx/rpc/remoting/mxml/RemoteObject.html">RemoteObject</a>, <A href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/html/help.html?content=data_access_4.html">Using RemoteObject components</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Zend?  http://devzone.zend.com/article/2019<br />http://blog.videgro.net/2011/02/adobe-flex-with-a-php-back-end/<br />http://php.dzone.com/news/architecture-flex-php<br />http://php.dzone.com/news/architecture-flex-php?page=0,1<br />http://ria.dzone.com/articles/php-and-flex-sockets<br />http://josescalia.wordpress.com/2009/03/09/my-first-flex-project/<br />http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=13371055430&topic=13570<br />http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=13371055430&topic=20686<br /><br /><br /><br />http://www.phpbuilder.com/columns/daniel_williams20071005.php3?page=1<br />http://www.phpbuilder.com/columns/daniel_williams20071005.php3?page=1</div>

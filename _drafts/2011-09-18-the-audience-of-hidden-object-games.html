I just started work at a company that makes hidden object games.  HOGs (the well-accepted yet gross-sounding abbreviation, haha) are quite different than social games, but I feel that the way developers view their audience is quite similar.  Thus far my (admittedly limited) experience in the industry has been that many developers regard their audience with bafflement.  </div>

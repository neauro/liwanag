<br /><i>This quarter I am facilitating a game design class at Puget Sound Community School for fun and lols. &nbsp;This is my story.</i><br /><br /><i>Other weeks can be found&nbsp;<a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/search/label/pscs">here</a>.</i><br /><i><br /></i><br />This week we had two games to play and analyze for story, which, for the purposes of this discussion, I defined specifically as the series of events in a game, as well as any emotional baggage. &nbsp;The first was <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/568367">And everything started to fall</a>.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-P4Ih2TkrTQk/T0pyCzkxjxI/AAAAAAAAAro/kEmv8Zc2p2U/s1600/everythingstartedtofallscreen.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-P4Ih2TkrTQk/T0pyCzkxjxI/AAAAAAAAAro/kEmv8Zc2p2U/s320/everythingstartedtofallscreen.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">screenshot of And everything started to fall</td></tr></tbody></table><br />We isolated the theme of the game as "life," and then listed the different ways that the player felt the pressure of this theme in their own actions and capabilities:<br /><br /><ul><li>The game is continually moving upward, forcing you to go along with it or perish and start over</li><li>You start as a child. &nbsp;As you get older, you gain mobility and speed</li><li>In the beginning, there are multiple paths you can take to go upward; but as you become middle-aged, there is only one path, and to get through requires literally swimming in money</li><li>The earlier stages of life are based more in "twitchy" gameplay, making sure you get to the right platforms, but later bits are more about slogging through, or literally "pushing" through as in the part where you are old and shoving through a pyramid of pills</li><li>That "pushing" bit can also be symbolic of how life becomes more of a struggle in general, one that holds you back even as it enables you (since at some point, making a ladder accessible requires you pushing a box beneath it)</li></ul><div>The second game was <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/486660">Don't Look Back</a>, which is one of my personal favorites.</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lIU54-aIkJI/T0p0vroAlcI/AAAAAAAAArw/zMaAExt9JzE/s1600/dontlookbackscreen.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="285" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lIU54-aIkJI/T0p0vroAlcI/AAAAAAAAArw/zMaAExt9JzE/s320/dontlookbackscreen.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">screenshot of Don't Look Back</td></tr></tbody></table><div><br /></div><div>It turns out that some students had trouble finishing this one though. &nbsp;It does get pretty challenging near the end. &nbsp;This game, compared to the previous one, feels more about the shooter/twitchy gameplay, and the story-driven "events" don't feel as proportional. &nbsp;Previously, there's birth, childhood, young adulthood, middle-agedhood, oldhood; here, there's this first short scene at the grave, the long descent, reunion, the long ascent.</div><div><br /></div><div>Next I dredged up some very slight and simple history of interactive games, starting with books where you could "choose your own ending" (which I hear is pretty popular on iPad now), proceeding with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_fiction">hypertext fiction</a>&nbsp;and the initial terror that writers had with it. &nbsp;<i>What if people aren't satisfied with reading stories that go from beginning to end anymore? &nbsp;What if human attention suffers from having to stop in the middle of a sentence to explore a new branch of story?!</i></div><div><br /></div><div>I remember reading about a hypertext fiction in a book whose title I can't quite remember, except for the fact that it referenced Star Trek. &nbsp;In it was detailed one example of a hypertext story of a man considering suicide, holding up his failures to the light, then grimacing, considering, <i>Wait, I have <u>my family</u> to live for, my <u>girlfriend</u>,</i>&nbsp;but upon clicking these links the reader would only find the narrator realizing, <i>No, my family can live without me, my girlfriend doesn't care about me. &nbsp;</i>There's no challenge to navigating a story like this, not in the sense that Don't Look Back presents the player with enormous demons to shoot down, but it's still presents players with "actions" that contribute to its theme: the brooding of someone in depression, the circling downward spiral of it, the way that seemingly good thoughts leave you with dead ends.</div><div><br /></div><div>I ended history with a brief mention of text adventures, which some of the students had played, and then moved on to some various descriptions of&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Sources:</div><div><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/GuyHasson/20111207/9057/Story_Design_Tips_Identifying_with_Characters.php">Gamasutra: Story Design Tips: Identifying with Characters</a></div><div><a href="http://evolutionlive.blogspot.com/2009/01/story-in-games.html">Evolution Live: Story in Games</a></div><div><a href="http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2005/10/between_stories.html">Only a Game: Story in Games</a></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><br /></div>

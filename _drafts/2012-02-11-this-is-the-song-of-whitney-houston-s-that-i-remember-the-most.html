Everyone always had to stand for this part, pushing aside thick jackets prematurely blanketed on laps, balancing gallon cartons of popcorn carefully on neighboring folded-up seats.  In the time that had passed since the last time I saw a movie at this theater I would forget about this video, so seeing it over and over again was always a pleasant surprise.  When she sings in this video, it looks so powerful, free, and <em>effortless</em>.<br /><br />At some point they tried playing another, more recent Super Bowl rendition of the Star-Spangled Banner, and after an outcry they resumed the Whitney video.  Nowadays, the theater staff play something that I suspect was handed to them by the government: an orchestral anthem set to soldiers diving into the ocean from helicopters, saluting with nostrils flared against the setting sun. &nbsp;Blatant patriotism is blatant, and somehow still not as <i>completely amazing as Whitney Houston.</i></div>

So I just finished reading <em>The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals</em> by Michael Pollan, which was published in 2006, which, aside from near-completely turning me off to anything but grass-fed food (why do I even bother eating at all anymore.  Everything is just corn), made me draw a couple interesting connections between the cultural view of food, and general food aesthetics, and how games can further speak to how people believe about certain fundamental things (and perhaps encourage them?).<br /><br /><strong>Item A: The omnivore's dilemma</strong>, which is simply, <em>What should we have for dinner?</em> (Pollan 1).  Unlike the specialized eater like a koala, for whom "if it looks and smells and tastes like a eucalyptus leaf, it must be dinner" (Pollan 3), humans are quite capable of eating a variety of foods, whether it be plant, animal, fungus, or mineral (salt): the problem is in deciding <em>what</em> to eat.  For that, humans rely on a couple of things, one of them the instinctive sense of <em>disgust</em> which removes from the set of edible foods those that are just gross (i.e. decaying flesh, feces) (Pollan 292).  Another thing that we rely on is cultural taboo: pressures like those that put us off to cannibalizing one another (other humans also being edible to the human) (298).<br /><br />We also rely on <em>cuisine</em>, which are our "set of rules for preparing food" (296), such as in Japan, where "the dangers of eating raw fish, for example, are minimized by consuming it with wasabi, a potent antimicrobial."  And more: "The meso-American practice of cooking corn with lime and serving it with beans, like the Asian practice of fermenting soy and serving it with rice, turn out to render these plant species much more nutritious than they otherwise would be.  When not fermented, soy contains an antitrypsin factor that blocks the absorption of protein, rendering the bean indigestible; unless corn is cooked with an alkali like lime its niacin is unavailable, leading to the nutritional deficiency called pellagra.  Corn and beans each lack an essential amino acid (lysine and methionine, respectively); eat them together and the proper balance is restored." (296)<br /><br />America's lack of a deep-seated cultural cuisine, Pollan says, is the reason why Americans are prone to eating disorders, fad diets (298): unlike the French, the (majority of us?) don't have cultural rules of what to eat and how to eat it, and so end up subscribing to one food fad after another, changing our diets based on whatever scientific evidence newly decides is horrible or else extremely good for us: chewing food one hundred times is good, carbohydrates bad, ketosis is good, starch bad, meat bad.  "A lone crackpot with a medical degree can alter this nation's diet overnight" (299)<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Item B: Chado, or tea ceremony,</strong> which I studied last quarter.  A big part of tea ceremony is its acceptance of mortality: every tea ceremony is meant to be regarded by its hosts and gusts as an event that may only happen once in a lifetime, even if the gusts see each other every day (Isao, 29).  Even if you see your friend or your mother or your brother every day, even if you have dinner together every night, each instance of dinner is <em>unique</em>.  The next time that you have dinner you'll likely be eating something different -- you'll be wearing something different -- you'll be at a different table, you'll have different thoughts and different conversations -- and every instant of time that you spend, at <em>that dinner</em>, is another instant of <em>that dinner</em> that you can never reclaim, even if you have a hundred more dinners together.<br /><br />"Chajin" or "tea people" also adore things that are transient; the chado aesthetic is littered with a love of things that live briefly and die.  <em>Ikebana</em> (flower arrangement) is done with flowers like <em>sakura</em>, which die at their peak bloom, and scorns flowers designated as (<em>kinka</em>) which are not "short-lived" enough.  <em>Kaiseki</em> tea ceremony meals are prepared by the host's hand with whatever happens to be in season at the time.  The pottery used for tea is chosen with respect to the season as well: thin cups which guests can hold in their hands to warm them during cooler times, and wide cups which help hot tea cool down more quickly during hotter seasons.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Item C: <a href="http://ds.ign.com/objects/018/018823.html">Rune Factory 3</a></strong>, <br />So I just finished reading <em>The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals</em> by Michael Pollan, which was published in 2006, which, aside from near-completely turning me off to anything but grass-fed food (why do I even bother eating at all anymore.

The pottery used for tea is chosen with respect to the season as well: thin cups which guests can hold in their hands to warm them during cooler times, and wide cups which help hot tea cool down more quickly during hotter seasons.  Authentic tea houses themselves also reflect this love of transience: authentic tea houses are made with few or no "modern" tools like saws, and are comprised of materials which are made to show their wear -- wood, walls made of straw and plaster, a roof which is at its most chado-est once its copper begins to oxidize, or its thatch begin to darken.  The sliding doors of tea houses and other chado-worthy architectures are also meant to emphasize a connection to nature -- they can be easily removed when the weather is nice, so as to better be "in nature," and put up when it's cold.<br /><br />In short: some of the things that chado loves the most is a connection to nature, and especially, to <em>seasons</em>.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Item C: <a href="http://ds.ign.com/objects/018/018823.html">Rune Factory 3</a></strong>, of which I played an absurd amount during the winter break after taking my tea ceremony class, which meant that I could fully appreciate its many chado-like sensibilities.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-c9SXPZVOZU4/TWHYr6-Fj9I/AAAAAAAAAIk/nnEGQTIqyyw/s1600/rune-cover.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="288" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-c9SXPZVOZU4/TWHYr6-Fj9I/AAAAAAAAAIk/nnEGQTIqyyw/s320/rune-cover.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="http://chrismorrisjournalist.com/2010/11/24/game-review-rune-factory-3-a-fantasy-harvest-moon/">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Firstly, the obvious case of being connected to nature: the main character of RF3 (after obligatory scene of waking up with amnesia, and subsequent, also obligatory, agreement to live out presumably the rest of his days farming) lives in a tree, beneath which is the field which he gamely takes up the responsibility of restoring to good health and productivity.  I only say obligatory because this happened in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rune_Factory">the first Rune Factory</a>, and I assume it happens in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_Moon_(video_game)">the other farming simulation games</a> developed by Natsume, though I haven't played them myself.  Compared to the first Rune Factory, at least, there were a couple interesting differences, including a need to be aware of how you were using the soil, as over-farming it would deplete the soil and take crops longer to grow.  Other than that, RF3 is pretty much what I expected it to be: a game where you become some young-looking kid, earning your living in almost primal circumstances, spending your hours farming crops, or fishing, or cooking, or crafting things to help you do all of the above better.<br /><br />The irony being that the sort of lifestyle RF3 idealizes, which I myself idealize and prove I love every time I play the game, is a lifestyle that I achieve <em>through a game</em>, rather than doing all these things myself.  What is it about RF that I love so much?  Probably that the life of a real farmer is grueling and full of Real Hard Work (not just pressing buttons to till and seed, and then restarting the game if I mess something up), as well as the fact that even if I plant things on a small scale, they usually end up dying long and desiccated deaths on my windowsill (like my strawberry plant, or my mint plant, despite my best efforts).  <br /><br />Still, I <em>like</em> this life: I like having new things to plant (and obsessively "level up") each season, I like the change in the scenery when a new season arrives, the snow in winter or else the eternally falling cherry blossom petals in the spring. I probably even like all the girls that I get to choose from to marry (though none of them as much as I like Raven &lt;3).   I like it at least to the extent to dedicate hours of my life to it, which means that I support it, and believe in it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Item D: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmville">FarmVille</a></strong>, which I also happen to play, which, despite also being a farm sim/social game/whatever, is completely different than Rune Factory, and more closely resembles the sort of "American" sensisibilities that Pollan mentions in his book.  Americans want any vegetable or fruit that they want at any time of the year, and stores like Whole Foods labor tomatoes over great distances just to have them on the shelf in December (259).  For the most part, once you grow a crop and harvest it in FarmVille, it vanishes into some figure -- you've gained money, you've gained experience points in this crop.  Unless you're at a high enough level to be able to harvest and sell bushels, all those crops get transformed into a sort of soul-less money; and even the bushels have a sort of "first you have a plant...now you have a commodity!" sort of feeling, unlike RF3, where, as Micah, you have to pluck each object of produce from the ground, you have to heave it over your head, you store it and thereafter process it, gaining money by placing it into a box, or creating it into something else by going into your kitchen.<br /><br />Both games are games, and as such provide levels of abstraction, removing me physically from the hard work of actually having a farm.  But I think there's still something to be said about the levels of <em>mental</em> abstraction that happen in these games, which I think reflects something pretty interesting about the way that Americans may feel about their food in the first place.  Why are 51,060,064 people (as of my personal <a href="http://www.facebook.com/FarmVille">checking</a>) playing every month?  Like me, do they do it to fulfill the "pastoral ideal," that one of human's "deepest, oldest longings...for a connection to the earth and to the handful of domesticated creatures we've long depended on" (Pollan 137)?  <br /><br />It could be that people are merely playing it for the addictive mechanics, the instant gratification: click here, click there, wait, get something.  Or, click here, click there, pay something, get something instantly.  Maybe they're not thinking about the pastoral ideal as much as the hoarding aspects (which is why I know my friend Leilani played it, spending her stint with the game measuring out precisely what hours she should plant things, and which things she could plant to get the optimal profit).  Either way, it fulfills some sort of need in the average player -- to get things, fast.<br /><br />Think about where FarmVille <em>isn't</em> like Rune Factory, and why.  With games, the reason why something isn't possible is probably because it isn't fun, and would probably stop people from playing.  Why can't you plant only crops that are in season (either in game season, or in real-life season)?  Because it would be too limiting.  Why can't you take your plants to your seller yourself, instead of the game automatically doing it for you?  Maybe because it would just be another click too many, to do something you were probably going to do anyway: sell your crops to get money.  FarmVille does have some recognition of time passing, and of seasons and particular holidays (I've witnessed myself, as a player, promos for Christmas, Valentine's Day, and now St. Patrick's Day, all of which involve asking Facebook Friends/obligatory relatives for presents or valentines or lucky pennies), but these events are less a about a connection to nature, and conforming to understanding of it, than about different ways to connect with people.<br /><br />Maybe this is the fundamental difference between <em>farming sim</em> and <em>farming social game</em>, but still: what about the non-social aspects?  Why aren't I limited to only planting crops that are in season?<br /><br /><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6224/catching_up_with_jonathan_blow.php?page=3">Jonathan Blow had his own opinions</a> about FarmVille, and though that particular article seems to be mostly about "damaging game design trends," he has this other statement:<br /><br /><blockquote>So then the question is if games are about learning, if every game teaches people something, then if I make any particular game, what is that game teaching people?</blockquote><br />What is FarmVille leaving out?  What do we <em>not care</em> that it leaves out?  And do we not care about it in the game because we don't care about it in real life?  In other words, for us, the player, FarmVille represents the sort of system that we don't question.  It outputs food, whatever food we want, the same way that when we enter a grocery store, we expect to pretty much just have whatever food we want.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />So then the question is if games are about learning, if every game teaches people something, then if I make any particular game, what is that game teaching people?

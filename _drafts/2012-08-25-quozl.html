As for the childbearing efmales, they were as confused as their mates, but unable to cope with a situation instinctively sensed as counterproductive and immature. This was the result of their physical inferiority, a physiological imbalance that Quozl scientists decided must be the result of an aberrant evolutionary process. Since male and female Quozl were always nearly of similar size and strength, relationships between the sexes had proceeded from a position of equality. And since female Quozl carried their infants in pouches which did not restrict their physical activity, they had no need of continual male protection. It was clear that the Shirazians were more to be pitied their condition than feared.<br /><br />"I'm not one of your fauna," Mindy protested. "You can try jumping all the deer and elk and porcupines you want, but keep away from me."<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />"It will be as you wish." Theme dipped both ears apologetically. "I will not transit your Sama again." He sounded so pitiful Mindy relented.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />When Runs had taken his colleages to hunt for amphibians, Chad confronted his sister.<br /><br />"I'm sorry he upset you, but don't you think you overdid it? You embarrassed him so severely in front of his peers he'll probably never show his face outside the colony again. Nothing could have happened. The Quozl are a completely different species. They're not like us at all, even if you want to throw in theories about convergent evolution."<br /><br />"You aren't actually thinking of bringing him to one of the meetings?"<br /><br />"I have to, little brother."<br /><br />"Don't call me that. I haven't hit you in fifteen years, Mindy, but you're convincing me that maybe I should start making up for lost time."</div>

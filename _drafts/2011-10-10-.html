One of the major struggles is being so unaware of the audience.  Our players seem to be regarded for the most part as 60-year-old women, which helps explain certain tendencies like their dislike of art featuring blurred foregrounds to mimic depth-of-field.  (This apparently can be confusing and/or annoying for players with bifocals.)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.bigfishgames.com/download-games/13125/redemption-cemetery-childrens-plight-ce/index.html">Redemption Cemetery: Children's Plight</a> was a recent game which was allowed by Big Fish Games to sell a coveted Collector's Edition, and which was #1 in BFG's Top 100 list for 28 days (according to <a href="http://casualcharts.com/games/detail/redemptioncemeterychildrensplightcollectorsedition.html">Casual Charts</a>, which is an incredibly slow website).  Children's Plight is presently rank #45, so it's managed to remain in the Top 100 since its release in mid-August.<br /><br />I mentioned Children's Plight because by these measurements, I would consider it pretty successful.  Yet, it lacks what I care most about: story.<br /><br />You, the main character, are taking an innocent walk in the park when you are suddenly abducted and put into Horrorworldwhatever.  A corvid lands before you and tells you that a warlock has placed you in this place.  Not only that, but the warlock has been stealing children and placing them in arbitrarily dangerous situations that you must save them from.  In saving them, you can restore peace to their dead relatives, and they will each grant you a key to destroying the warlock and freeing you from Horrorworldwhatever.<br /><br />But wait...what?  Who is corvidman?  Why can he shapeshift?  Why does he want to help me?  Why did the warlock kidnap me?  Surely it wasn't so that I could spend the next three hours foiling his plans?

Whether or not a game becomes a CE is determined by Big Fish and its arsenal of test players; developers submit a build of the game, players play it and fill out a survey, BFG gives the game a rating depending on the survey results.  If the game scores higher than a 4.2/5, it's a CE. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />http://invisibleinkblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/tell-em-what-youre-gonna-tell-em.html<br /><br /><br /><br />I've been working on the story for a new hidden object/puzzle/adventure game.

because she's female, is not white, may not have straight hair, and is some magical parallel form of programmer in the imaginary world that I am creating.<br /><br />I dislike <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Sue">Mary Sues</a>&nbsp;just as much as the next person, but this accusation wouldn't be as easily lobbed as a white author who decided to create a white character with straight hair.<br /><br />To be fair, it was probably the "programmer" bit that shoved it a little too far into personal territory, but really, she's not going to be sitting at monitors Vimming all day, she's going to be logicking housekeeping golems.<br /><br />It's important that this character is<i>&nbsp;</i>"like me" in the described fashion because recently I've been wading in young adult fiction, a lot of it dystopian, and the commonalities (though delicious in a deep-seated way) are starting to wear me out. &nbsp;The societies that have been "perfected" for everyone's good are filled with straight, white people, with trivial, token mention of minorities or queer people if at all. &nbsp;It's unsettling to think that in this futuristic fictional perfect society (sometimes set in America), the first to be cleansed away are people like me. &nbsp;And yes, the societies are deeply flawed -- but the reason why <i>isn't</i> because marginalized communities are nonexistent.<br /><br />I understand that you can't be expected to write outside of what you know. &nbsp;You <i>shouldn't</i>&nbsp;have to write outside what you want to write, at all. &nbsp;And that's why I want to write this story -- not just for me, but for people like me, or even just someone, somewhere, like me.<br /><br />But in hearing criticism already of my recently-conceived main character, I feel like I can hear the dismissal of a broader audience. &nbsp;<i>This isn't a story that everyone can enjoy</i>. &nbsp;<i>This is a story only for people like her, or maybe even just for her. &nbsp;She made the character too much like herself.</i><br /><i><br /></i><br /><br /></div>

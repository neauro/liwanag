Discussion with <a href="http://evolutionlive.blogspot.com">axcho</a> concerning hidden object game design has led me to think more about what makes strong character.  Strong Character is just not something you can have a precise recipe for, no matter how many times you've consumed it.<br /><br />It's hard enough for me to think of good examples of Strong Character.  In particular, I want to think of characters that did more than <em>stand out</em>.  The kind of character that I want to sculpt is like an old friend, a relative, or a crush -- you love to see them and to be with them, you love doing stuff with them, you get hungry for gossip about them.  Zelda's Link is a character that everyone can recognize and feel fondness for, but I'm not <em>completely, unreasonably obsessed</em> with figuring out something about him, the way that I played Apollo Justice intent to learn anything that would tell me what happened between Phoenix and Maya.  <br /><br /><br />good characters<br />Phoenix Wright<br />Toy Story<br />Katniss & Prim & Peeta<br />Kurosaki<br />Toy Story<br />Lelouch<br />Last Airbender<br /><br />vs.<br /><br />good story & also good characters<br />Hell Girl<br />Junpei (999)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I also wonder what games have been able to really focus and evoke strong "character, emotion, and motivation." I feel like Aerith dying in FF7 is an obvious one, but I never played it myself and could never feel sorry for her in earnest now that I know that she dies (though I did read a touching story once about how the devs allowed you to continue pressing buttons as she was about to die, to allow you to feel more helpless about it).  Kidnapping girls/sisters/siblings in general seems like an accepted cop-out for motivation, haha.  I feel a blog post coming on...<br /><br /><br />JUSTICE<br />http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jbpws/whats_the_biggest_overreaction_youve_ever/c2au13x<br />http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jbpws/whats_the_biggest_overreaction_youve_ever/<br /><br />haha i love the hillary duff story on the 'worst things you've done to a customer'. good shit, privilege<br />haha i love this thread<br />the reddit story thread i mean<br />also ours<br />like, does it make me feel better as a person knowing that douchebags exist?<br />or do i just enjoy cringing at other peoples discovery of what goes around comes around?<br />I'll use my fathers story. We owned a restaurant years ago in a strip mall next to a bar. Parking was assigned by business, but people would constantly park in our spots. One day a man in a newer corvette convertible parked right in front of our store and walked toward the bar. Dad stopped him and asked him to move his car, as there were plenty of other spaces available. He laughed, and said "try and tow me you fucking chink". My dad shrugged, waited for about twenty minutes and then stabbed his two front tires with sharpened wire, right in the sidewall. The tires didn't deflate right away because the hole was small. I'm sure they did over the next day or though.<br /><br />http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/j37at/whats_the_worst_thing_that_you_have_done_to_a/<br /><br />the set up, and everything falling into place perfectly<br /><br />the world turning upside down -- euphemia<br /><br /><br /></div>

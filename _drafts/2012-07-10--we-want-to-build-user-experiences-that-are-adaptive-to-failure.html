database failure shouldn't interrupt the rest of customer experience<br />offline scenario: faucet is clogged up and spilling everywhere. if security guard were to come through and say "DROP YOUR SHOPPING CARTS AND LEAVE THE STORE!" then it's frustrating; minor issue shouldn't close the whole store.<br />online scenario: stack trace errors/exceptions are sub-optimal.even with an error it's the same as telling the user "drop your cart and leave the store."<br />anything can throw a bug on a site. but what is the site's CRITICAL PATH, versus the actions that provide insular &nbsp;value?<br />so if something is off, just remove that thing from the page, rather than throwing a huge error that takes up all the page.<br />on new york times: the most important thing is for people to be able to come and read the news. if that isn't there, people will jump ship.<br />what are your site's contents and services? if you can't respond, are you throwing people out the door?<br />UI should have graceful degradation.<br /><br /></div>

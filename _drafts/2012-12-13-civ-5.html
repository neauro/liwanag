<div class='post'>
I bought Civilization 5 during the autumn Steam sale because heaven forbid a Steam sale pass without me buying anything. Think of all the money saved!<br /><br />The Civ series also just seems like one of those things that I Should Have Played, and I was also intrigued by the fact that it's viciously enjoyed by some of my friends despite their lukewarm feelings towards video games in general.<br /><br />After floundering around for a while and getting frustrated after repeatedly moving workers instead of actually getting them to build things, I dug around the navigation and found the tutorial section. There are a couple chapters meant to teach you </div>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><ul><li>It is hard to get money. &nbsp;Also hearts! &nbsp;Listen. &nbsp;<i>It is hard to get hearts.</i>&nbsp; Suddenly I actually have a reason to use my precious bottles for <i>potions</i>, which I have never found good reason to use in Zelda games in lieu of fairies. &nbsp;(Okay, though to be honest, I still don't spend money on potions, because money is, as mentioned previously, hard to get, and I'd rather spend money on things that allow me to have more money, like extra wallets.)</li><li>It's hard to kill things. &nbsp;You have to think! &nbsp;You can't just press buttons or waggle your wrist aimlessly until something dies! &nbsp;Yes, waggling will not work anymore (in most cases...you could probably still get away with it, but it's definitely less efficient)!</li><li>Sound effects. &nbsp;This game has all the pretty chiming noises of Wind Waker. &nbsp;I can hear it from my brother playing in the next room. &nbsp;He just opened a treasure chest and got a Rupee of some kind.</li><li>The new hint-giver, Fi. &nbsp;I love her tremendously. &nbsp;I love her synthesized singing android voice, which despite it being nonsense still sounds Japanese and perfect for [insert mecha anime here]. &nbsp;I love the inexplicable ice skating routine she does when she relays messages to you from the gods (a la <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shizuka_Arakawa">Arakawa</a>?). &nbsp;I love it when she asks me questions like "Did you just see who passed by here?" and I can say "Was it Zelda?" and she will falter and say, "Er, that person did not look like Zelda at all, I would say that person had only about a 5% chance of being Zelda...yes, it's very unlikely."</li><li>The feeling of having that huge world to explore, and of flying to all the different places. &nbsp;I feel like one reason people really hated Wind Waker was because you had to sail to all those different islands, and sailing was tedious and boring -- I never found it that way myself, but I do think that flying the Loftwing from place to place is an improvement on it -- it feels like you have to think a little bit more, and in general I guess the task of flying is novel.</li><li>The whimsical-ness! &nbsp;I had no idea that I was even craving this until I saw (spoilers) that one demon dude who has the huge blue-and-yellow wings and who begs you to help people so that he can gather Gratitude Crystals to become human. &nbsp;Or maybe I realized it when I went onto that FUN FUN ISLAND place and there was the clown there who just wanted to make that floating island in the sky filled with fun and colors. &nbsp;Or maybe I realized it when you visit that shopkeeper in the day and he glares at you whenever you ask to look at something and then don't buy it. &nbsp;Or maybe it was when you visit that other shopkeeper who bicycles all day to keep his flying shop afloat and when you visit him and don't buy anything he opens up a trap door and just drops you. &nbsp;Dear Zelda series, thank you for being unafraid to be just fun and silly.</li><li>Speaking of whimsical-ness, all these <i>characters</i>, man. &nbsp;I watched my roommate and her boyfriend play Oblivion and they ran into a lot of folk with whom they could speak with in varying ways, but none of those people had a fraction of the heart that I feel <i>every</i> speaking character in Zelda has. &nbsp;I haven't had in-depth conversations with any of the people that live in your hub island (spoilers) but I feel like I <i>know</i>&nbsp;them -- the overweight doting father and his sardonic daughter, the businesswoman and her timid but well-meaning househusband, the little kid that wants everything, the enthusiastic do-gooder knight who loves birds and his loving mother who always calls out to you to take care when you leave her house, that one lovestruck but cowardly bully with a pompadour, that old embittered man with stories about monsters no one believes...oh my gosh. &nbsp;The list just goes on and on.</li><li>The little references to itself. &nbsp;I'm probably just getting off on my alternate universe fetish again but I love (spoilers) those little hints -- the little Triforces everywhere, the way Zelda's father is named Gaebora, the first three areas you visit and how they're named after the three goddesses -- I will eat it up all day om nom nom.</li><li>(spoilers) Zelda is not just a princess in a tower this time, hurray. &nbsp;Now she has a (sort of) agency in that you're running around trying to catch her while she tries to fulfill her duty as a Spirit Something (I forget exactly what). &nbsp;In any case, I welcome any plotline nowadays in which the creators could have legitimately gotten away with putting the love interest in an abduction situation, and didn't.</li><li>The way that it continues to make all these areas so new and fresh. (spoilers) That first dungeon? &nbsp;All the mushrooms and stuff?! &nbsp;Oh man! &nbsp;And the second area, with those dog-looking digger people that at first looked evil but then turned out to be <i>so nice? &nbsp;</i>And then, the third area? &nbsp;With robots! &nbsp;Whoa!</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>I started loving video games as played on a console, and though I'd like to say that console games are nearest to my heart, I reflected and realized that I haven't been legitimately hyped for a console game since Persona 4 came out for the PS2 in 2008. &nbsp;Before that, it was Twilight Princess in 2006. &nbsp;I would hesitate to even call myself a Real Zelda Fangirl because I haven't played the very first ones in the series, but man, Zelda has so much of the stuff that made me adore video games so much -- compelling story, beautiful places to explore, interesting characters to meet, and solid gameplay.</div></div>

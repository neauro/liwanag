I just finished <i>Kraken</i> by China Mi√©ville.  (I found it amazing; but then again, I totally get off on this "weird fiction" business, which I concede that some people don't like -- for instance Andou, who seemed to find the concept of gunfarmers eyebrow-furrowing at best.  Come on!  People who murmur fertility prayers before shooting people so the egg-bullets can take root and hatch in flesh!  <i>Isn't that awesome?</i>)<div><br /></div><div><i>Kraken</i> is the 29th-or-so book that I've finished this year.  This brings brings my number of books read this year about equal to the number of books that I finished in the entirety of last year.  ("Books" includes comic books as well as books mostly about photography like <i>Rare</i> -- if it matters.)</div><div><br /></div><div>I think I can blame my new burst in reading to having a <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/02/owning-kindle-in-seattle-as-student.html">Kindle</a> -- obtaining books is a lot easier, and immediately after finishing one I usually move hungrily on to the next.  Only about half of the books I've read so far have been on the Kindle, but the ones that I tend to read on paper now are those </div></div>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I've been listening to <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/">RadioLab</a>&nbsp;recently, and they've been pushing this app called "Stitcher," which seems thus far to be like a kind of Pandora but for radio talk shows. &nbsp;One of the first screens you see is this:</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-p-2spzZuDRU/T-SrEOATNwI/AAAAAAAABM4/ymv43fY-gsA/s640/blogger-image-2143628725.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-p-2spzZuDRU/T-SrEOATNwI/AAAAAAAABM4/ymv43fY-gsA/s640/blogger-image-2143628725.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">aw man</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><div>Hellooo, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_(media)">echo chamber</a>. As much as I might feel like I align to one side of American politics, I just can't find legitimate reasons for choosing to listen to just one side of things, much less taking a broad thing like "politics" and cleaving it down the center, as if some issue were always just visible from a Conservative or Liberal perspective and there was no way to dissect it more deeply.<br /><br />I've recently been reading <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lies-My-Teacher-Told-Everything/dp/0684818868">Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong</a></i>, by James W. Loewen. &nbsp;The main idea is that American history textbooks are Eurocentric, and downplay the failures and vices of American heroes and government. Things that I've learned from this textbook, which I did not learn in my 2006 history class, include the following:<br /><br /><ul><li>President Woodrow Wilson, best associated with women's suffrage, was a white supremacist</li><li>British colonists scalped Native Americans, not the other way around; and Vietnamese during the Vietnam War had their ears made into trophies by American troops</li><li>Patrick Henry ("<i>Give me liberty or give me death!</i>") was a slave owner</li><li>Christopher Columbus started this thing where Native Americans had to pay tribute in gold or cotton to white settlers every three months, or else their hands would be cut off</li><li>the Trans-Atlantic African slave trade came after many Native Americans had been enslaved and distributed across the Atlantic (sometimes in such great number and in such poor conditions that ships were described as needing no compass to guide their path, but needed only to follow the bodies of Native Americans floating on the water...yikes)</li><li>Squanto was an amazing badass who was sold into slavery in Spain, ended up in Europe, and managed still to return to his tribe's land in New England</li><li>Helen Keller was a socialist, who had written this: "I had once believed that we were all masters of our fate -- that we could mould our lives into any form we pleased...I had overcome deafness and blindness sufficiently to be happy, and I supposed that anyone could come out victorious if he threw himself valiantly into life's struggle. But as I went more and more about the country I learned that I had spoken with assurance on a subject I knew little about. I forgot that I owed my success partly to the advantages of my birth and environment...Now, however, I learned that the power to rise in the world is not within the reach of everyone."</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>Like seriously, <i>look at that Helen Keller quote</i>. &nbsp;That is like <i>We are the 99% </i>status, and definitely not along the lines of the "All I needed to succeed was within me all along :)" stuff that I usually hear associated with Helen Keller.</div><div><br /></div><div>The more I read about this book the more I'm thrown into a sort of mindboggling sense that high school history is everything that's wrong with the world. Well, not <i>everything</i>&nbsp;wrong with the world, but the presentation of American history -- as a constant march of progression, washed clean of class struggles that might be evidence of "socialism" and American impurity forbidden by publishers -- the more I feel like I've been infected. Specifically, with the "illness" of <i>Everything has to be 100% good, or is not good at all.</i>&nbsp;Why didn't I know that Patrick Henry and Jefferson owned slaves, why didn't I know that Woodrow Wilson told jokes about "darkies" and did his utmost to segregate or remove them from federal government? Did the textbooks think that this would have prevented me from seeing what good did come from his administration?Or prevent me from having adequate patriotism?<br /><br />It's kind of a stretch, but I feel like I see this "illness" in people's occasional inability to hold discuss politics with people who don't agree with them, or even to discuss issues like feminism and racism. We just haven't had the practice. high school textbooks are blindingly optimistic or else downright erroneous, and everyone heads straight for STEM in college.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div></div>

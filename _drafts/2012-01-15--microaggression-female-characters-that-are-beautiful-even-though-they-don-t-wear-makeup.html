I first read about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_(video_game)">Wet</a>&nbsp;in a video game magazine during lunch at my first internship. &nbsp;The developers were talking about Rubi, the main character -- how they tried to make her movements flowy and fluid, and how one of the best things about her was that she was rugged, the type of girl that didn't wear makeup and was still beautiful.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0hU3Hroj3VQ/TxMwt7cu3gI/AAAAAAAAAm4/hPU9Y6w9rkQ/s1600/WET_Hero.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="139" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0hU3Hroj3VQ/TxMwt7cu3gI/AAAAAAAAAm4/hPU9Y6w9rkQ/s320/WET_Hero.JPG" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">0% eyeliner, lipstick, or eyebrow alteration here!<br />also, those layers are <i>totally </i>natural&nbsp;(<a href="http://uk.playstation.com/ps3/games/detail/item229416/WET/">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I unfortunately can't find the original article, but I did find people in forums expressing the same sentiment.<br /><blockquote><i>I was just saying she is more human and natural than most female charachters in videogames nowadays. Rubi dosn't wear makeup, yet still looks really good, She looks natural.</i> -- <a href="http://www.tombraiderforums.com/archive/index.php/t-167035.html">source</a></blockquote>It's not bad to like women (much less video game characters) who don't wear makeup.<i>&nbsp; </i>But it is annoying to hear people associate "natural beauty" with attractiveness that is actually obtained through use of makeup (or not-natural means in general, i.e. 3d Studio Max or what have you). &nbsp;In the end, I think mentioning Rubi's use (or lack thereof) of makeup serves to point out that she isn't vain or fake, like women who <i>do</i>&nbsp;use makeup. &nbsp;She doesn't need to work hard at it, like women who <i>do</i>&nbsp;use makeup. &nbsp;Beauty should be natural, effortless, and eternal!<br /><br /><br /></div>

But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone - tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness. The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth...and any chance for rescue. As fear turns to panic, every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left. But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.</blockquote><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1">I saw <i>Gravity </i>with A last week. It was alright. People warn that the movie will cultivate in you a brand-new fear of nothingness but I have to say that what terrified me the most was the crescendo of the soundtrack, thickening and filling me with anxiousness before anything had even happened. The death of Goerge Clooney's Matt also seemed to me to be unreasonably tragic, especially given the fact that he could have been <a href="https://twitter.com/neiltyson/status/386990527406563329">easily rescued</a>.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">I would have liked Matt's sacrifice to be foreshadowed more clearly; the reasons for his final no-nonsense altruism were unclear. Did he sacrifice himself out of a sense of duty? Out of logic? Out of love for Ryan? The story poses life as utterly valuable — worth proceeding with, despite internal struggles and pain — yet allows Matt to give up his existence so easily. I don't understand how he came to decide Ryan's life was valuable. I don't even understand how Ryan herself decided this about her own life at the end, laughing and monologuing and screaming as she fell back to the earth.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">I'm biased, maybe — why someone would want to cling to life in the immensity of space is something I was anticipating this movie would explore. Since my personal contemplation of space eventually lends itself to existential panic and dismay that my life is so small compared to a millennia of life and death and nothingness,&nbsp;I wanted to see how this movie would handle it, to see how many mad hyperventilating spirals it would take to get down to hell and come out the other side. I wanted to know what it was people were really missing out there in space, and what was it that kept pulling them back to Earth.</div><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1">(....eh? <i>Ehhhh?</i>)</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2">On a completely different note, the morning before I watched <i>Gravity </i>was the morning I started reading about the Kessler syndrome in <i>Best American Nature and Science Writing 2011</i>…what a weirdly exciting coincidence. I wanted to stand up in the theater. "Guys! GUYS...IT'S THE KESSLER SYNDROME!"</div></div>

Identity becomes an illusion as they struggle to assemble the loose fragments of wrecked lives. (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084989/">via</a>)</blockquote><div class="p2">[spoilers]<br /><br /></div><div class="p1">A and I watched <i>Upstream Color </i>this weekend, per the recommendations of various friends and coworkers. As someone on Reddit stated, one great thing about it is that the director does not underestimate the intelligence of his audience. As a viewer, I felt as if I was running to keep up —pausing at one scene with just enough time to grasp at understanding — before rushing on to the next — the next — the next.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">A and I noted some scenes with awe at the "show, don't tell" attention to detail. For example, at some point, the female protagonist says to her love interest, "Let's buy a car," and the next scene shows them driving an old vehicle with the price still painted on the windshield. I found the first "hyponosis" scene awesome for its strangeness, and yet so disturbing that I couldn't bear to watch parts of the protagonist's violation.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">I loved that the medium so closely reflects the characters' mental state; the choppiness of the timeline mirrors the difficulty that I imagine they must have had trying to reconstruct their lives after having been so compromised. The story also explores some facets (symptoms?) of the hypnotic state that I enjoyed; for example, once the main characters start telling stories to each other, they begin accepting them as their own, and begin arguing about whose memories actually belong to whom.</div><br /><div class="p1"><i>Upstream Color </i>is great in its focus; it address the exploitation of hypnosis, and the repercussions of it on a human's brain. (Will the victims ever be okay again? What does "okay" even look like anymore?) <i>Upstream Color </i>requires an intellectual athleticism that leaves you a little sore by the end, in a way that's not unpleasant.</div></div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Q0m6jPYOR0U/UXcmxeJsgFI/AAAAAAAADhQ/3DcTLZZuIS4/s1600/220px-O%CC%84kami_Kodomo_no_Ame_to_Yuki_poster.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Q0m6jPYOR0U/UXcmxeJsgFI/AAAAAAAADhQ/3DcTLZZuIS4/s1600/220px-O%CC%84kami_Kodomo_no_Ame_to_Yuki_poster.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_Children">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><div><br /></div>(spoilers)<br /><br />I watched <em>Wolf Children: Ame and Yuki</em> the other day and was taken aback at how I pretty much had tears flowing continuously down my face, starting from the dam scene until the end of the movie . (What is it like to love someone and then see their body thrown into the back of a garbage truck? <em>Oh God</em>)<br /><br />It’s a story that I would be surprised to find in the US, because despite the fact that the title alludes to the wolf-shapeshifting children, the story is just as much about their mother, Hana, and her struggles to raise the children, aided only by her dead partner’s dwindling savings. She learns about natural birth to avoid going to hospitals; she fights off health inspectors; at some point her daughter accidentally ingests detergent and there’s an amusing scene of her rushing off into the night and then glancing desperately back and forth between a children’s hospital and a pet clinic.<br /><br />Though Hana misses her partner, at no point does she ever really find a replacement for him, or need another man at all. Even when she moves into the countryside, she receives assistance from the entire community there (though there is vaguely tsundere old man involved). Though her partner was a wolfman and is the reason why her children are also partially wolves, he just isn’t a part of the equation after he leaves. It sounds simple, but it’s such a relief that there are stories out there about women persevering, doing their own thing against all odds, and ultimately finding a place where they (and their children) can just be themselves.<br /><br />It’s also just a relief to see a woman who isn’t vilified for being a single mother, who isn’t ultimately viewed as lesser and unwhole for her lack of a man, who loses him and continues to move on with her life. Despite what much media would have you believe, without men, women keep existing and struggling towards their own goals.<br /><br />It's true that Hana’s motivations center almost entirely on the health of her children, which on its own isn’t terribly stereotype-breaking, but I appreciated how Hana didn’t lose her personality to become a faceless machine of a mother figure, a character wholly defined by her offspring’s emotions. Her bright attitude could have been unbelievable, but was acceptable to me because it is something established as a defining trait: "Even at my father’s funeral I laughed." And even so, it doesn’t mean she’s perfect: she often admits her ignorance (and remedies it thoroughly researching all her problems), she cries, she bandages her fingers, she panics, and rubs her back when it aches. You also get a glimpse of Hana's life as it was before motherhood, and a little "after," once her children have embarked <br /><br />And now that all of that is said — though <em>Wolf Children</em> impressed me with its focus on Hana as a single mother, after talking about this movie with Heather, I learned that the "virtuous mother" is actually a trope not uncommon in Eastern narratives. I haven't noticed it much, but will definitely be keeping an eye on it from now on.</div>

By the end of the film, Jack's character also undergoes a transformation to solve his problem:&nbsp;<i>My purpose is to share my love of "fun" with children, and now they believe in me. </i>In contrast, Ralph's "transformation" seemed weak and frustrating to me personally; at the beginning he is a character who longs for recognition and acceptance, and at the end becomes happy because he gets...recognition and acceptance. It's just a little boring. It's like a story about someone who says, "You know what I would like? $5." And then that someone meets a princess who gives him $5. The end!</li><li><b>The other primary characters interacted with Jack in ways that helped him with his transformation.</b>&nbsp;Santa teaches Jack the idea of a "center," or something that Jack is <i>all about,</i>&nbsp;which Jack realizes he doesn't know. Tooth teaches Jack that he was someone before he was Jack Frost, and later is an example of how the Guardians have become misaligned with their previous love of caring for children. Bunny is a sort of litmus test for Jack's familiarity with the Guardians, and the Sandman's death was what triggered Jack's supercoldblizzard power (or whatever). The antagonist, Pitch, was also a foil for Jack, representing the "bad side" of wanting to be seen and recognized so badly that you would want children to fear you. In contrast, the interactions between Ralph and characters like Felix and <strike>Jane Lynch</strike> Sergeant Tamora were pretty shallow, and after the Hero's Duty part of the movie, whenever you saw Tamora it was really just for romantic comedy fluff that had nothing to do with the movie's title character.</li><li><b>The Tooth Fairy had her own not-man-related things going on, </b>including but not limited to control of whatever the fairy army is called and a love of gummy, bloody teeth that was amusingly ridiculous. Compare to the Sergeant, whose motivation is hate for the bug-things because they killed her husband (in her fake memories). It's true that Tooth was fangirly about Jack's teeth and all of her fairy minions were swooning over Jack's hoarfrost bangs but I'll take what I can get.</li><li><b>No romance! </b>(Beyond that too-long hug at the end between Tooth and Jack?)&nbsp;Just, thank you for not stuffing that into the movie, especially since it was already bursting its seams with all the fast-paced kingdom-touring and gold particle effects. (On a related note, #rainbowsnowcone and #frostbite seem to be what the shippers are calling Frost/Tooth.)</li></ul><br />There were a couple plot holes in the movie that bothered me somewhat (Why did they only need to round up teeth for one night to save Tooth? After everyone fell asleep in Jamie's room, why were they suddenly in the sleigh, still-sleeping, later?) but I have been reading <i>Wired for Story</i>&nbsp;by Lisa Cron recently, and one of its tenets is that good stories are not about what just events that happen, but about the changes that happen in their characters. I'm not ready to forgive all plot holes for this reason, but it does give me a new lens into what details are the most important in story. In the case of these two movies, Jack's change from the invisible, meaningless delinquent into someone that uses his fun for good is what made him so much more compelling to me, and enjoyable to watch as well.</div>

<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bFB05LsWkIA/UKhosEP7vYI/AAAAAAAACzw/UQjAzcxVmlQ/s1600/Wreckitralphposter.jpeg.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bFB05LsWkIA/UKhosEP7vYI/AAAAAAAACzw/UQjAzcxVmlQ/s400/Wreckitralphposter.jpeg.jpeg" width="268" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wreck-It_Ralph">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Went against the <em>Skyfall</em> rush to see&nbsp;<em>Wreck-It Ralph</em>&nbsp;the other weekend. The popularity&nbsp;of <em>Skyfall</em> didn't mean that <em>Wreck-It&nbsp;</em><em>Ralph</em> had open seats, however, so Andou and I&nbsp;opted to see the still-open 3D movie.<br /><br />[spoilers]<br /><br />It was super beautiful, and all the video game&nbsp;references at the beginning were pretty delightful,&nbsp;yet not, in my opinion, cheesy and overwhelming. It&nbsp;was fun to hear people practically scream at the&nbsp;Metal Gear Solid reference, though my personal&nbsp;favorite was a shot of Sonic blinking and losing his&nbsp;rings after being hit by that spaceship thing :D<br /><br />Overall I was really impressed by the clarity of the&nbsp;story, especially given the risk of confusion&nbsp;resulting from relying on too much video game&nbsp;esoterica or fanservice. Certain words and certain&nbsp;settings threw their weight into the plot's goings-on, and it was nice to feel that the things&nbsp;you saw were, for the most part, not just shiny&nbsp;fluff, but would actually deliver on some interesting and relevant happening.<br /><br />One thing that I just couldn't stand was the&nbsp;character Vanellope.&nbsp;I couldn't muster up sympathy for her at all. @__@  I&nbsp;guess the idea is that her immaturity, selfishness,&nbsp;and spontaneity are okay because she's a child and&nbsp;she has enormous caramel apple-colored eyes? As a&nbsp;character who seems solely there to be "adorable" and&nbsp;act as a motivation for the protagonist, I felt&nbsp;mixed...and had a lot of weird feelings about the&nbsp;character interactions in general.<br /><br />On one hand, it's nice that Ralph finally finds&nbsp;"goodness" not in the accumulation of shiny extrinsic things&nbsp;(like that "Hero" medal), but rather in helping&nbsp;others (specifically, Vanellope). On the other hand,&nbsp;the whole "I'm Ralph and just seeing Vanellope be&nbsp;happy is what I need to be happy :')" had a heteronormative tinge -- <em>Helping children be&nbsp;</em><em>happy is the most important thing in the world!&nbsp;</em>-- and ultimately I feel like I wish Ralph had come&nbsp;to learn more about what he does personally that make&nbsp;him uniquely happy, rather than having his newfound&nbsp;happiness hinge so much on helping a specific person realize their aspirations. I mean, the movie is called <em>Wreck-It <strong>Ralph</strong></em>, right?<br /><br />The inevitable marriage between the only other female main character and the only other male main character was also hugely wince-inducing, just because it seemed so...forced...and inevitable. (Ack! I wince just thinking about it!)<br /><br />Anyway, Vanellope seems unexpectedly popular on Tumblr, so I'm still musing on the reasons why I don't like her. Maybe I missed something...</div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
I've recently started using <a href="http://www.trello.com">Trello</a> to keep track of my myriad projects, and I love it because I can use it as an always-accessible repository of lists for ideas regarding games, writing, websites, homework, and so on. It's also great for keeping track of resources like free icon sets. I've also been using it to manage and focus on what things are actually currently on my plate, and making sure I don't overextend myself.<br /><br />My prime reading time has always been during my commutes, but I have been reading less because I've discovered <a href="">IA Writer</a>, a writing app which features a simple UI, a re-arranged keyboard, and integration with iCloud (which took me forever how to use; but it's way more convenient than e-mailing myself everything). I absolutely adore it and have been using it for writing practice, which has in general alleviated my plaguing anxieties about not writing enough. I tried writing on the bus with my sketchbook but the bus's movement made my scribbles illegible; typing on my iPod makes things easier, and even a little fun.<br /><br />I have also been hard at work on my part of this year's group cosplay, Black Rock Shooter. I was initially going to go for Demon Cannon User, but then a friend dropped out due to busy-ness, and now I'm rocking Strength, for which I am actually attempting to build up strength to carry around the huge cardboard hands that Andou is helping me make.<br /><br />Winter quarter is also in full swing. This quarter I'm taking my first "practical" class, usability testing, and it's funny — I always thought that I would find practical classes more immediately applicable — but instead I'm finding myself missing theory courses, where you could learn a theory and apply it <em>immediately</em>, instead of waiting to gather participants and test. I'm working with a group to improve and analyze the usability of <a href="http://www.mappingvoices.org">Mapping Voices</a>, which I was interested in for the potential application of game design — for example, how can you encourage people to take action against health inequity? How can you make people feel productive taking action?<br /><br />Though it looks like our suggestions will have to hold up against a bureaucracy and generally complicated organization, I'm looking forward to contributing to a local organization!</div>

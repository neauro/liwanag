    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FS01GyXZtMU/TdtOqq5GybI/AAAAAAAAAOM/KqG4OmKmecU/s1600/kongregate_users.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="197" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FS01GyXZtMU/TdtOqq5GybI/AAAAAAAAAOM/KqG4OmKmecU/s320/kongregate_users.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">the first 200-some players of our silly capstone game</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It's been about 24 hours since <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/getAcross/get-across">our first online release of Get Across</a>.  Our capstone class recommends moving from Newgrounds, to Kongregate, but then to Facebook, but it's taken us such a long time to learn Player.IO that we skipped straight to Kongregate, as <a href="http://playerio.com/documentation/quickconnect/kongregate">Player.IO already supports this.</a>.<br /><br />Still, our release was (to me) a little rushed, and I would have loved nothing better than to clutch the game even tighter and keep anyone from seeing it at all.  We have presentations on Tuesday on what our first round of releasing reveals to us about the game, and I haven't parsed through the data that we've collected yet, but an onslaught of a mysterious error regarding null quest objects made me really self-conscious about what was going on.  <em>I don't want anyone to play a game that is still buggy.  Nononononono!</em><br /><br />It's hard to debug from Player.IO's error log, though it is very informative concerning what errors popped up, whether they were serverside or clientside, when they happened, and how often.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UwlYNphQNgA/TdtRshfzMqI/AAAAAAAAAOU/u3pc3S_SXdQ/s1600/playerio_errorlog.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="186" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UwlYNphQNgA/TdtRshfzMqI/AAAAAAAAAOU/u3pc3S_SXdQ/s320/playerio_errorlog.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">just look at those graphs, dude!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Some of the players on Kongregate have been really helpful in leaving comments about their thoughts and the bugs they've encountered; but there are about 6 of these comments, and 200+ registered players, most of whom didn't really make it through the tutorial levels.  I have a good guess why: <em>the tutorials take forever to load</em>.<br /><br />I'm not sure why, but I'm guessing it might be because we have a lot of objects in the database, and a lot of the properties of those objects are nested objects or arrays, which must take longer to retrieve.  Seeing as tutorial levels are pretty essential for hooking in initial players, I'm hoping to make it so that the tutorial levels are completely static and client-side -- no saving data into the database, nothing.  If a player comes back, they'll just have to start over.  Hopefully this will make it so that we only really save "real" player data in the database as well, and keep out the clutter.<br /><br />So even though I really wouldn't have wanted to release the game this soon, this little bit of playtesting illuminated something that we otherwise would have learned at the last awful minute, for the final Facebook release.  Which is nice.<br /><br />As a sidenote, the last push I made to Get Across before the release were updated character sprites for our classes, "Cook," "Crafter," and "Planter."  Charlie drew the first set, which were endearingly derpy --<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BpSQDmsoKDg/TdtS8xpShpI/AAAAAAAAAOc/xeVTMU2HQDw/s1600/old_classes.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="131" width="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BpSQDmsoKDg/TdtS8xpShpI/AAAAAAAAAOc/xeVTMU2HQDw/s320/old_classes.png" /></a></div><br />And these are the more recent ones --<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-X1nWWgR4z_E/TdtTFRAwnII/AAAAAAAAAOk/QkC5Sdg-LI0/s1600/getacross_classes.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="131" width="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-X1nWWgR4z_E/TdtTFRAwnII/AAAAAAAAAOk/QkC5Sdg-LI0/s320/getacross_classes.png" /></a></div><br />Hopefully more character customization will come soon, though it's hard to say what we'll have time for.  2 weeks left to polish up the back-end code and the mechanics!</div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
So <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/search/label/operating%20systems">OS</a> ended, and the world didn't, and I'm taking the games capstone this quarter.  I've wanted to take this class for forever, and finally...!<br /><br />But all the initial excitement was broken by the professor's declaration on the very first day.  "The requirement this quarter is that you all have to make social games."<br /><br />A sudden discomfort in the room.  Social games?  <em>Really?</em><br /><br />We brainstormed hastily, still in shock, and during discussion exchanged mutters.  "I really wanted to make a <em>real</em> game this quarter."<br /><br />Hard to think otherwise then <a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2011/03/the-social-games-rant-you-didnt-hear-from-gdc/">people tend to feel so visceral about social games.</a> <span class="shh">(That link is there more for the comments than the actual article.)</span>  Around the time the Zynga/Hidden Agenda competition started, I started playing FarmVille for t3h research, and I've continued playing it, alongside FrontierVille, though I like the original FV much better -- it lags on my computer less, and I have more Friends who play it, which makes it slightly easier to obtain gifts and stuff.  Plus I guess I'm more into the whole pastoral ideal thing than <strike>manifest destiny</strike> the wild wild west.<br /><br />I've been trying desperately to work out why people hate social games so much and made the mistake of asking my Facebook network about it.  Given the fact that the intersection of Friends who are a) on the Internets and b) video game savvy are also c) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I7xHg7kmr0">intense about Smash</a>, I generally received snark and pointers to <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/33059/Braids_Blow_Social_Games_Are_Not_Very_Social.php">interviews with Jonathan Blow</a>.<br /><br />But, anyway.  I guess the point is that I've been going over it back and forth without much conclusion.   To me, boiled down to their barest bones, FarmVille and WoW (more accepted in that group) are not so much different.  The mechanics encourage you to stick around in exchange for endorphins and the illusion (?) of productivity.  Click something, get something.  Millions of people just float happily in this broth every day.  Why get angry about it?<br /><br />That being said, I was (not completely) swayed to drop the class at the mention of ~*Social Games*~ like a couple other people were, though it would be a lie to say that I wasn't disappointed at all.  It's hard to think of new social games when things like Zynga and Bejeweled Blitz occupy so much of social game mindshare.  But I wracked my brain and when Andreas started talking about a cardgame called Heartbreak (the rules of which I cannot find online right now, as he described them to me) I decided to apply this to a board game and BAM.  GAME IDEA.<br /><br />PRESENTED IMPROMPTU IN FRONT OF THE CLASS THE NEXT DAY.<br /><br />EARNING NO INTERESTED CLASSMATES INITIALLY.<br /><br />THEN, TWO!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Fs5lsvP0CnE/TZ6x_hiv1SI/AAAAAAAAAK8/IWF2FBnShA0/s1600/getacross.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="241" width="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Fs5lsvP0CnE/TZ6x_hiv1SI/AAAAAAAAAK8/IWF2FBnShA0/s320/getacross.jpg" /></a></div><br />We've worked it out a little more and did the presentation pitch and I think we're actually off to a good start.  My half-hearted, half-hated social game idea is now something that I'm pretty excited about!  It's called <strong>Get Across</strong>.  The objective of the game is to get across a board, or "terrain," comprising obstacles such as mountains, monsters, bodies of water.  You can specialize in three classes, and "leveling up" grants you more ability cards.  It's essentially a collaborative online board game.<br /><br />I don't want to get my hopes too high, but it will be a success if I can have my Smash- and HoN-playing friends to play this game and enjoy it, play it and have that sort of heart-racing, "We're working together and beating everything!" feeling at least once. :x</div>

And I mean, TED talks, amirite?<br /><br />But as the lecture progressed, it started talking more concerning giving feedback based on students' education and such, all very game-y things which made it more obvious why it was being circulated through that mailing list.<br /><br /><blockquote>But then I started getting letters from teachers. And the teachers would write, saying, "We use your videos to flip the classroom...what I do is I assign the lectures for homework. And what used to be homework, I now have the students doing in the classroom."<br /><br />...when those teachers are doing that, there's the obvious benefit -- the benefit that now their students can enjoy the videos in the way that my cousins did. They can pause, repeat at their own pace, at their own time. But the more interesting thing is -- and this is the unintuitive thing when you talk about technology in the classroom -- by removing the one size fits all lecture from the classroom and letting students have a self-paced lecture at home, and then when you go to the classroom, letting them do work, having the teacher walk around, having the peers actually be able to interact with each other, <strong>these teachers have used technology to humanize the classroom. They took a fundamentally dehumanizing experience -- 30 kids with their fingers on their lips, not allowed to interact with each other. A teacher, no matter how good, has to give this one size fits all lecture to 30 students -- blank faces, slightly antagonistic -- and now it's a human experience. Now they're actually interacting with each other.</strong></blockquote><br />That technology is the humanizing thing, rather than classrooms, definitely is not intuitive at all -- and when I hear something like assigning students videos for homework, the first thing I think is, <em>Are they really going to do this?</em> Are high school and younger students really going to subject themselves to mental stimulation outside of school itself?<br /><br />I guess the main belief is that people really do want to improve themselves, and will do so, given the opportunity; this is a big part of <em><a href="http://realityisbroken.org/">Reality is Broken</a></em> by Jane McGonigal, which I'm presently reading (and almost done with!).  She writes that one of the things that's essential to human happiness is "the experience, or at least the hope, of being successful.  We want to feel powerful in our own lives and show off to others what we're good at.  We want to be optimistic about our own chances for success, to aspire to something, and to feel like we're getting better over time."<br /><br />Which brings me back to my high school, which always bothered me.  We were reknowned for having tons of AP courses and turning out students that did really well in them; I took AP Computer Science A and AB there (back when AB was still offered) and our teacher told us that the girls in our class were the stark majority of all the girls that took the AP Compsci test.  By graduation, I'd taken around 12 AP courses, with grades of 3 or above in all the tests. <span class="shh">Damn you, Chemistry!  And Physics B!  Arrrghhh</span><br /><br />One thing that was unique about our school was that if you wanted to take an AP course, you could; there was no minimum GPA requirement, no test that you had to pass.  For some national government bill simulation, our class tried to pass a bill that would allow this sort of "If you want to take a harder course, do it" behavior in every high school, but it was voted down by some east coast school that said, essentially, "If you just allow anyone to take an AP course, then you will ruin the class for everyone else.  The teacher will have to cater to these dumb people, the discussions will have to be held on a lower level, we deny it."<br /><br />Which made us all really angry, I guess, and talking about it with my friends later, we pretty much agreed: If you're failing behind in class, it's not the teacher's fault, sorry bro, you've just got to keep up.<br /><br />So if you wanted to take AP Everything in our school, you could -- and I kind of imagine this as also being parallel to having that opportunity to be better, to learn more.  Our AP courses, however, had a reputation for being pretty difficult, which, though it may be true, also contributed to what I think was an unfair gap in our school.  On one side were the AP students; on the other side, your stereotypical high school students who traded drugs during lunch and graduated to work at the mall a couple miles from the school.<br /><br />This itself is an unfair description, but also what happens, not just in one high school, when education is offered and only a subset take advantage of it.  If education is all about success and being better, why do some students not pursue it, despite its realtion to basic human happiness?  What is it about our present education system that is anti-compelling?<br /><br />And we AP kids, who I speak of so highly, what did we really learn -- did we come out of high school with grades that prove usable knowledge, or are our A's just badges of facts that we've memorized and will forget the next year?<br /><br /><blockquote>In a traditional classroom, you have a couple of homework, homework, lecture, homework, lecture, and then you have a snapshot exam. And that exam, whether you get a 70 percent, an 80 percent, a 90 percent, or a 95 percent, the class moves on to the next topic. And even that 95 percent student, what was the five percent they didn't know? Maybe they didn't know what happens when you raise something to the zero power. And then you go build on that in the next concept. <strong>That's analogous to imagine learning to ride a bicycle, and maybe I give you a lecture ahead of time, and I give you that bicycle for two weeks. And then I come back after two weeks, and I say, "Well, let's see. You're having trouble taking left turns. You can't quite stop. You're an 80 percent bicyclist." So I put a big C stamp on your forehead and then I say, "Here's a unicycle."</strong><br /><br />But as ridiculous as that sounds, that's exactly what's happening in our classrooms right now. And the idea is you fast forward and good students start failing algebra all of a sudden and start failing calculus all of a sudden, despite being smart, despite having good teachers. And it's usually because they have these Swiss cheese gaps that kept building throughout their foundation. So our model is learn math the way you'd learn anything, like the way you would learn a bicycle. Stay on that bicycle. Fall off that bicycle. Do it as long as necessary until you have mastery. The traditional model, it penalizes you for experimentation and failure, but it does not expect mastery. <strong>We encourage you to experiment. We encourage you to failure. But we do expect mastery.</strong></blockquote><br />"Encouraging failure" or at least allowing it, accepting it, and using it, rather than punishing it, is also a very <em>game</em> thing.  I'm reminded of when Andreas told me a story about a teacher of his who was a little eccentric, an intelligent world traveler (or something of the sort) who abruptly settled down to become a teacher and allowed his students to take tests over and over again until they learned the material.  If you have an opportunity to do better, to <em>be</em> visibly better, I don't know who would leave it.<br /><br /><span class="shh">I mean, I guess if I had the opportunity to be visibly better at baseball or something it probably wouldn't matter to me.  But that's because I already have other things that I'd rather be improving.</span><br /><br />Something else that I really like about this anti-traditional model is the idea of <em>experimenting</em>, which I feel was really lacking in my education up until a very recent point (as in, a couple of months ago, when I realized <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/02/game-bonding-time.html">I could make games</a> if I wanted).  A lot of grade school is all about just learning basics -- which is good, but I wish that it wasn't in college that you started questioning <em>why</em> something happens, and start to expand on ideas, and be imaginative.<br /><br />At 11:48 of this video, there's a presentation of a "dashboard" which basically shows a detailed breakdown of how each student is doing.<br /><br /><blockquote>Green means the student's already proficient. Blue means they're working on it -- no need to worry. Red means they're stuck. And what the teacher does is literally just say, "Let me intervene on the red kids." Or even better, "Let me get one of the green kids who are already proficient in that concept to be the first line of attack and actually tutor their peer."</blockquote><br />This whole part reminds me of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=new+york+game+school">the game school</a> in New York, which, despite being incredibly awesome and employing game techniques to improve students' will to learn, seems incredibly specific.  Though both this dashboard and the game school use visible acquisition of mastery to motivate students, I could see the dashboard being more easily used by schools like my old high school.  Something like this is not just helpful to motivate students, but to allow them to see where they need help -- no small feat, really, because I've always thought that the biggest obstacle to learning something is knowing the right question to ask.<br /><br />I wonder if any teachers actually take talks like this seriously.  Whenever I think of grade school education, it seems incredibly set in its ways.  If it changed, what would happen to all the iconic high school drama and archetypes?  YOU CAN'T HAVE A "THE SMART KID" IF EVERYONE IS SMART, OKAY.</div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
And even when I received the confirming e-mail, I honestly didn't think that it was that big of a deal.  No one ever talked to me about grad school -- not my parents -- I didn't really get what the difference was between an MS and a PHD until a month ago.  It was only ever seriously mentioned to me by my high school computer science teacher, and even then I don't think he meant for me to pursue HCDE/HCI/H-etc., which, despite my great interest in it, still seems to me to be a sort of "liberal artsy" type of study, and therefore somehow not as prestigious as something mathy or sciencey.  (No offense to any liberal artsy folk -- after all, I am one of you at heart -- and surely you must know too, the feeling of somehow being <em>wrong</em> because it seems like <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2009-11-23/politics/obama.science_1_science-education-math-and-science-president-obama?_s=PM:POLITICS">even the president disapproves of you</a>.)<br /><br />In any case.  I am happy that I'm working on a degree in computer science, but the fact is that I really feel like I just haven't...felt like I've learned everything that I wanted to.  I feel like I've spent most of my undergrad years half-asleep at the wheel, and now I've only just woken up and realized that I can do <em>other things</em>, I can stretch beyond given assignments, I can apply for jobs and pick myself up if it doesn't work out.  And that's why I went after the Master's, mostly: because I've really liked what little I've learned about design, because I want more reasons to stay in Seattle, because I still want to be a student, because I was cruising Bungie's site and it had one position I was interested in, and for this position they were hiring people <em>with advanced education in HCI or related fields</em>.<br /><br />Today I broke the news to Alex and he hugged me super tightly, the same way Mariko and Leilani did, and he congratulated me like Andreas and even his parents did, and I started to feel like, <em>Wait.<br /><br />Is this more important than I think it is?  What have I gotten myself into?</em><br /><br />I am looking forward to it, though.  I hope that when I arrive at that first class, when I get my first homework assignment, that I feel like it's a delight to do and not a chore.  What a novel thing, to be so excited about studying.</div>

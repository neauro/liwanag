    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
At Fugazo, I was hired initially to design a hidden object game. I've made a couple of posts about&nbsp;<a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/search?q=hidden+object">this type of game</a>, but never talked about mine, which was going to be a fantastical version a la <a href="http://www.boomzap.com/">Boomzap</a>'s <i>Awakening</i> series, which would hopefully shine in a market saturated with grimy amusement parks and children being stolen and dangled off cliff-ledges by evil wizards.<br /><br />The premise of the story was that a village had had its special crown stolen by a thief, who wanted it for a queen in a distant land, who in turn wanted it so she could look cool at parties. The crown was a symbol of the ancient pact the village had with the elements, and upon its disappearance havoc arose: cookfires burst, water slid away from mouths and flasks, the air blew cold, stones rolled across the feet of weary villagers, etc.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YtmP55ls_xA/UAN1Xkcy1CI/AAAAAAAABqs/WjAqz6RtxtQ/s1600/elements+map+3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="481" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YtmP55ls_xA/UAN1Xkcy1CI/AAAAAAAABqs/WjAqz6RtxtQ/s640/elements+map+3.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">a sketch of the world map;<br />the big part is the temple, the bottom-left part the village</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The elemental avatars were housed in a temple with four quarters on some massive landmass overlooking the village. Wanting to set things straight, the villagers send a girl to temple to make peace, and she ventures bravely despite the fact that avatars are known to turn annoying trespassers into statues or sparrows or whatever else pleases them. Upon arriving at the temple, the girl runs into a talking hawk, who aids her in her quest with dry banter and the occasional vague StarCraft reference. ("You need more crystals! ...to finish this mini-game")<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c-L6g8ERer0/UAOpUQ1fCiI/AAAAAAAABsE/PW2TzcL9s_s/s1600/elements+dragon.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c-L6g8ERer0/UAOpUQ1fCiI/AAAAAAAABsE/PW2TzcL9s_s/s640/elements+dragon.jpg" width="584" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">the avatar of the fire temple, a kind of fuzzy dragoness</td></tr></tbody></table><br />In the end, it turns out that the hawk has been the thief all along; he had been turned into a hawk as punishment for getting lost and rummaging around the sacred temple. At the conclusion of the game, an epic match-three-kinda mini-game ensues in which the girl/you defeat him and win the crown back.<br /><br />I spent a lot of time playing other games for ideas on mini-games, and prototyping them out on paper, and testing them against coworkers.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1ZQsf6z184g/UAN4jKVzGbI/AAAAAAAABrA/t4dbVRs3tpA/s1600/c1d4510e072011e1a87612313804ec91_7.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1ZQsf6z184g/UAN4jKVzGbI/AAAAAAAABrA/t4dbVRs3tpA/s320/c1d4510e072011e1a87612313804ec91_7.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">a photo of a paper prototype inspired by UW's <a href="http://games.cs.washington.edu/Refraction/refraction.html">Refraction</a></td></tr></tbody></table><br />I also spent a non-negligible amount of time outlining the various areas of the temple in a composition notebook, which I filled to the margins with cheap ballpoint ink (as it is a favorite tool of mine, beside Steadler mechanical pencils).<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6xHGGSMHnWE/UAN395Irb3I/AAAAAAAABq4/oLIc7ojXnkc/s1600/elements+earth+temple.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="408" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6xHGGSMHnWE/UAN395Irb3I/AAAAAAAABq4/oLIc7ojXnkc/s640/elements+earth+temple.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(page 1/2) a scan of my sketchbook with various areas drawn out for the "earth temple"</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-l9XshfoY4Tk/UAOq_xYyZBI/AAAAAAAABsM/CE3zetuT_Hs/s1600/elements+forest.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="415" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-l9XshfoY4Tk/UAOq_xYyZBI/AAAAAAAABsM/CE3zetuT_Hs/s640/elements+forest.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(page 2/2) a scan of my sketchbook with various areas drawn out for the "earth temple" </td></tr></tbody></table><br />I also laid out certain rooms and angles for detail and fun.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--x7SzByFqJ8/UAN50iElStI/AAAAAAAABrI/l2aJAKT3C-M/s1600/elements+fire+temple.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="185" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--x7SzByFqJ8/UAN50iElStI/AAAAAAAABrI/l2aJAKT3C-M/s320/elements+fire+temple.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">sketch of the fire temple's "tea room"</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-B4vx2Xcbrws/UAN53Woe0FI/AAAAAAAABrQ/OHHMFzZI2Mg/s1600/elements+water+throne.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="184" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-B4vx2Xcbrws/UAN53Woe0FI/AAAAAAAABrQ/OHHMFzZI2Mg/s320/elements+water+throne.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">sketch of the water temple's "throne room"</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-c5z8VivuyT0/UAN5_IwrX6I/AAAAAAAABrY/I4cvgSpziUk/s1600/elements+fire+overhead.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-c5z8VivuyT0/UAN5_IwrX6I/AAAAAAAABrY/I4cvgSpziUk/s640/elements+fire+overhead.jpg" width="434" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">sketch of the fire temple</td></tr></tbody></table><br />One unfortunate thing is that I don't have much in-game art to show. Since the art made from these sketches is "really" the work of my team's artists, I'm not comfortable sharing it. What mini-games were implemented aren't something that can be easily shared either, as are the environments and dialogue that I scripted out using our in-game scene editor...so, bummer.<br /><br />Why was the project canceled? Mainly because our small team (one designer, one programmer, and roughly four artists) couldn't compete with much larger teams working on the market. Art style is at the forefront of the hidden object genre, with many players turning away if something is too dark or too colorful, and we didn't have the power to create, polish, and re-polish within a reasonable timeframe, especially with the paint-y style that we wanted to move forward with. &nbsp;There was also greater interest with pursuing more "game-y" games, hidden objects being fairly linear.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mPTPHA4aTQo/UAOokIYbyJI/AAAAAAAABr8/bTRj-F6cECw/s1600/elements+air+temple.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="408" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mPTPHA4aTQo/UAOokIYbyJI/AAAAAAAABr8/bTRj-F6cECw/s640/elements+air+temple.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">sketches of the air temple, which (spoilers) was going to be on the back of a bird<br />that blue is a plastic tape-bookmarker-thing</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Perhaps some elements of...Elements...will be recycled for future projects.</div>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bPeKp0xqrN0/TqEALG74F4I/AAAAAAAAAec/XbOusWYUmWY/s1600/blog-pic.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bPeKp0xqrN0/TqEALG74F4I/AAAAAAAAAec/XbOusWYUmWY/s320/blog-pic.png" width="210" /></a></div><br />Our company game jam ended after some many and tiring but exciting hours.  With much help from <a href="http://evolutionlive.blogspot.com/">Alex</a> on the building of our trampoline web mechanic, I think we were able to make a pretty interesting game, one that I think would be fun to take to other places (if I ever find the time, gah).<br /><br />The theme of our game jam was "restraint," which immediately made me think about spiderwebs, and from there me and my teammate came up with a cute story relating to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spider's_Thread">The Spider's Thread</a>, which is an old Japanese short story.  From there I super focused on re-learning <a href="http://flixel.org/">Flixel</a>, and team-mate handled art assets and story, which luckily he was quite enthusiastic about.<br /><br />Flixel has a lot of cool things now, like an interactive debugger which acts as a trace log as well as a running poll for whatever variable you wish, and can also allow you to rewind and pause gameplay.  (To open it, press "~" while your game is running.) Luckily, it is easy to get the hang of, even when trying to remember how to make a FlxRect.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gFziC3DIE1I/TqEAEAHjgcI/AAAAAAAAAeQ/M9JF_rreJMc/s1600/proto4.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gFziC3DIE1I/TqEAEAHjgcI/AAAAAAAAAeQ/M9JF_rreJMc/s320/proto4.png" width="212" /></a></div><br />Alex helped a ton with the web mechanic.  The idea is that the player would be able to draw webs between obstacles in order to propel themselves towards the heavens and nirvana.  However, the web for some reason wouldn't anchor on some of the obstacles, so we secretly made it so that you could draw webs anywhere on the screen, and since we explained the mechanic as "Anchor your webs on obstacles!" no one knew the difference. :D<br /><br />Other interesting design-y things:<br /><ul><li>I initially wanted to make the obstacles randomly generate and fall down, but then we discussed what would happen if blocks fell in an unfortunate pattern that hemmed a player in, so we made the blocks breakable -- hopefully allowing players to have a feeling of happiness when destroying something</li><li>This meant the player would need health to limit from just breaking through everything, and may have to make grueling decisions like "Should I just bust through this obstacle for mad points" or "Should I take the long route to replenish my health with a floating, rotating soda can"</li></ul><br />Hopefully I'll be able to revisit this project again sometime to really polish it up.  In the meantime, you can read more about this project and the other game jam projects on Fugazo's <a href="http://www.fugazo.com/archives/1715">blog</a>.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IsnU69WbRd8/TqMoufbw2FI/AAAAAAAAAes/4j2cpl2pRiM/s1600/proto7.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IsnU69WbRd8/TqMoufbw2FI/AAAAAAAAAes/4j2cpl2pRiM/s320/proto7.png" width="214" /></a></div></div>

Our CEO and one of the designers attended the conference and were subsequently impressed by the fact that many of the finalists, like Sissy’s Magical Ponycorn Adventure, had been created in one or two days during the <a href="http://arisgames.org/global-game-jam-2011/">2011 Global Game Jam</a>.<br /><br />So, now we're having a company-wide game jam!<br /><br />I don't yet have a "dedicated" programmer on my team, so I'm programming for myself.  I haven't touched Flixel in 4 months but maybe if I hit myself against it hard enough, for for long enough, everything will be just fine.<br /><br />Our theme was "restraint" (a theme from a previous GGJ).  Our game's present working title is just "Spider," and I need to get back to it!<br /><br /><strong>Update:</strong> "Finished" game post is <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/10/game-itsy-bitsy-spider-of-cosmos.html">here</a>.</div>

    <id>http://yoursite.com/blog/2011/02/16/game-bonding-time</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-u0vR2MtUWDw/TVyji_MufeI/AAAAAAAAAHU/eDXX8Sa_udg/s1600/bondingtime_titlescreen.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="239" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-u0vR2MtUWDw/TVyji_MufeI/AAAAAAAAAHU/eDXX8Sa_udg/s320/bondingtime_titlescreen.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />So yesterday we finally finished the atom game that me, Jimmy, Leilani, and Chris have been trying to do for the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/haproject">Zynga &amp; Hidden Agenda</a> competition.  The point of the competition is to make a game which will "teach high school students" someting.  We all signed up around September and November with the initial idea of making something that would be like Oregon Trail but for ethnic studies, but eventually decided against it because ethnic studies (done right) is a subject that's not taught properly in high school for a reason (i.e. general controversy), I think :/<br /><br /><span class="shh">So, that game will come later.</span><br /><br />Over winter break (during which I was rabidly playing <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2010/12/9-hours-9-persons-9-doors.html">999</a>) there was one scene (spoilers?) with a passcode that you figured out based on the number of atoms in a molecule, so I got the idea of making a game based on how atoms bond with respect to valence electrons, and how (most) atoms strive to have eight valence electrons and will form bonds with other atoms to achieve this.<br /><br />Since 90% of my AP Chem course in high school was all about memorization, I thought that some advantages of a game like this would:<br /><ul><li>provide a slightly more fun way to memorize things like all the polyatomic ions that the College Board decided were important to memorize</li><li>also help people visualize more how atoms get bonded together, hopefully leading to understanding of why something like organic chemistry is its own course (apparently because carbon is super good at bonding with itself; who knew)</li></ul><br />I met with Alex over winter break and to get a refresher on chemistry (which I haven't thought about since those ancient high school times) and (in between greeting people returning to Homedale Mall for the holidays <span class="shh">(Maggie and Colin are getting married!!)</span>) we went over a couple concepts.  He pointed out that rather than rote memorization, it would be more helpful to remember certain patterns of bonding (somthing related to alkanes and alkenes, etc.) and also had good ideas of a sort of RPG-style game where you could level up and create different types of bonds by applying heat and other chemicals and stuff. In the end I think that will be saved for another possible game, since I couldn't understand it myself well enough to try and teach it to other people (despite the fact that I realize teaching something is the best way to learn it).  In any case, I wanted to keep it pretty simple.<br /><br />So then the gameflow started to look like:<br /><ol><li>Game gives players a molecule to assemble (i.e. "OH," H20"), as well as a random assortment of atom sprites</li><li>Player tries assembling putting the required atoms together (i.e. pushing together an "O" and an "H" atom)</li><li>Player is rewarded with points and a mildly amusing (yet honest) description of what role that molecule plays in Everyday Life</li><li>Rinse, lather, repeat</li></ol><br />After that, we all met and broke down into separate teams.  We decided to use <a href="http://flixel.org/">Flixel</a> (which Kathleen showed me and I was super excited to use! :D) and then tried to work out the implementation.  Other than managing the state of the game (i.e. points, timer, propagating atoms to the screen) the main difficulties turned out to be <strong>bonding</strong> atoms, and <strong>validating</strong> bonds that the player had made.  I wanted the game not just to see that the molecules players assembled where all together, but that they were bonded in the right places -- so if a player were trying to bond H20, a bond that went like<br /><br /><br /><center>H-H-O</center><br /><br />would be invalid, whereas something like<br /><br /><br /><center>H-O-H</center><br /><br />would be, since the real-life situation is that a pair of H atoms bond to an O.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Zyh-voWylFI/TVyyl3vz5-I/AAAAAAAAAHk/YH9wL6cdILk/s1600/Covalent_H2O.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="310" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Zyh-voWylFI/TVyyl3vz5-I/AAAAAAAAAHk/YH9wL6cdILk/s320/Covalent_H2O.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">like so! (<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Covalent_H2O.png">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />In the end, the bonding function came to deal purely with atom behavior, i.e. atoms being moved about by the player and sticking together and then moving as one once they were "bonded." Atoms contained data about who their neighboring atoms were.  Validation took a single molecule, then compared the connections and neighbors against a "validation code."<br /><br />So, if we had the case of H-O-H, we could make a "validation code" which would contain data about the correct neighbors of each atom -- in this case, <code>h_o1-o_h2-h_o1</code>, which meant "a hydrogen with 1 oxygen neighbor, an oxygen with 2 hydrogen neighbors, a hydrogen with 1 oxygen neighbor."<br /><br />It worked :D And it meant that atoms could be bonded in any order, yay!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZWKDaDp6U4k/TVysvYL3ycI/AAAAAAAAAHc/Mgg9I_Hfu7Y/s1600/bondingtime_firstbond.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="238" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZWKDaDp6U4k/TVysvYL3ycI/AAAAAAAAAHc/Mgg9I_Hfu7Y/s320/bondingtime_firstbond.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />The game is <a href="http://neauro.com/flash/atomgame.swf">here</a>.  We've turned it in, but I can't help thinking of all the things that I would have wanted to change if we had more time... (.___.  I guess I can add it in the future.  Specifically:<br /><ul><li>put in some visual cue about which molecule is "selected" to bond (right now, the molecule which will get checked is just the last one clicked)</li><li>put in more visual cues about how electrons get shared between atoms (i.e. if two fluorine atoms get placed together, it should show that they both share one electron to bring each one's total number of valence electrons to 8)</li><li>put in more visual cues about the nature of bonds in a molecule (i.e. if it's a single or double bond)</li><li>put an undo button, for goodness sake; if someone makes a mistake right now, you just have to refresh the whole set of atoms on screen D:</li><li>better icons for bond/reset/skip functions (since according to <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em>, text labels on anything indicate poor design)</li><li>add more, and more interesting, atoms</li><li>add a bonus round of some sorts, where maybe the objective would be to just try and get as many atoms as you can bonded together...I don't know -shrug-</li></ul><br /><br /><br />...my very first game!  I'm still pretty proud. :D</div>

Haha, thanks. :D But c&#39;mon, you have done some pretty amazing stuff as well!  You do a ton more little experiments then I do, and have been learning about things for much longer!</div>

Wow, you actually did this? That&#39;s awesome. I wanted to do something like this back when I was taking chemistry classes. I feel like a loser who comes up with ideas and then never actually does them. You&#39;ve done all this cool stuff and found people to do them with.<br /><br />I congratulate you!</div>

My favorite thing to do is start projects, particularly those that involve huge copious amounts of writing, so it stands to reason that I've been wanting for like forever to make a blog in which I could attempt making pro conversation/discussion with myself about things that I want to learn/practice/improve upon in general.<br /><br />My project threads are as follows:<br /><ul><li><strong>Red Moleskine:</strong> For whatever form inspiration strikes in, including abruptly making some observation about the weather, drawing up a database schema for a web app (that I found out has already been done), sketching out shiba inu people, etc. etc.</li><li><strong>Spotty Daiso Notebook:</strong> For taking note of the myriad of programming/software-design related things that I have no idea about, so that I actually look them up later; also, to keep track of tasks for school research projects</li><li><strong><a href="opalitewires.blogspot.com">Opalite Wires</a>:</strong> For practicing writing something completely uncalled for every single day</li><li><strong>Normal Blog:</strong> Also for practicing writing something completely uncalled for every single day, but also for purposes of coming back months later to ooze nostalgically over whatever I wrote the previous year and see whether I'm still friends with the people that I talked about</li></ul>This makes for tons of ideas that are all over the place, and ANYWAY, the point is that, the objective of <em>this</em> blog is: to try and consolidate, into a relatively intelligible way, all the things that I do in all the other threads.<br /><br />IT WILL MAKE SENSE WHEN THERE'S MORE THINGS.</div>

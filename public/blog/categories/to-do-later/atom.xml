<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-u0vR2MtUWDw/TVyji_MufeI/AAAAAAAAAHU/eDXX8Sa_udg/s1600/bondingtime_titlescreen.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="239" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-u0vR2MtUWDw/TVyji_MufeI/AAAAAAAAAHU/eDXX8Sa_udg/s320/bondingtime_titlescreen.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />So yesterday we finally finished the atom game that me, Jimmy, Leilani, and Chris have been trying to do for the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/haproject">Zynga &amp; Hidden Agenda</a> competition.  The point of the competition is to make a game which will "teach high school students" someting.  We all signed up around September and November with the initial idea of making something that would be like Oregon Trail but for ethnic studies, but eventually decided against it because ethnic studies (done right) is a subject that's not taught properly in high school for a reason (i.e. general controversy), I think :/<br /><br /><span class="shh">So, that game will come later.</span><br /><br />Over winter break (during which I was rabidly playing <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2010/12/9-hours-9-persons-9-doors.html">999</a>) there was one scene (spoilers?) with a passcode that you figured out based on the number of atoms in a molecule, so I got the idea of making a game based on how atoms bond with respect to valence electrons, and how (most) atoms strive to have eight valence electrons and will form bonds with other atoms to achieve this.<br /><br />Since 90% of my AP Chem course in high school was all about memorization, I thought that some advantages of a game like this would:<br /><ul><li>provide a slightly more fun way to memorize things like all the polyatomic ions that the College Board decided were important to memorize</li><li>also help people visualize more how atoms get bonded together, hopefully leading to understanding of why something like organic chemistry is its own course (apparently because carbon is super good at bonding with itself; who knew)</li></ul><br />I met with Alex over winter break and to get a refresher on chemistry (which I haven't thought about since those ancient high school times) and (in between greeting people returning to Homedale Mall for the holidays <span class="shh">(Maggie and Colin are getting married!!)</span>) we went over a couple concepts.  He pointed out that rather than rote memorization, it would be more helpful to remember certain patterns of bonding (somthing related to alkanes and alkenes, etc.) and also had good ideas of a sort of RPG-style game where you could level up and create different types of bonds by applying heat and other chemicals and stuff. In the end I think that will be saved for another possible game, since I couldn't understand it myself well enough to try and teach it to other people (despite the fact that I realize teaching something is the best way to learn it).  In any case, I wanted to keep it pretty simple.<br /><br />So then the gameflow started to look like:<br /><ol><li>Game gives players a molecule to assemble (i.e. "OH," H20"), as well as a random assortment of atom sprites</li><li>Player tries assembling putting the required atoms together (i.e. pushing together an "O" and an "H" atom)</li><li>Player is rewarded with points and a mildly amusing (yet honest) description of what role that molecule plays in Everyday Life</li><li>Rinse, lather, repeat</li></ol><br />After that, we all met and broke down into separate teams.  We decided to use <a href="http://flixel.org/">Flixel</a> (which Kathleen showed me and I was super excited to use! :D) and then tried to work out the implementation.  Other than managing the state of the game (i.e. points, timer, propagating atoms to the screen) the main difficulties turned out to be <strong>bonding</strong> atoms, and <strong>validating</strong> bonds that the player had made.  I wanted the game not just to see that the molecules players assembled where all together, but that they were bonded in the right places -- so if a player were trying to bond H20, a bond that went like<br /><br /><br /><center>H-H-O</center><br /><br />would be invalid, whereas something like<br /><br /><br /><center>H-O-H</center><br /><br />would be, since the real-life situation is that a pair of H atoms bond to an O.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Zyh-voWylFI/TVyyl3vz5-I/AAAAAAAAAHk/YH9wL6cdILk/s1600/Covalent_H2O.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="310" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Zyh-voWylFI/TVyyl3vz5-I/AAAAAAAAAHk/YH9wL6cdILk/s320/Covalent_H2O.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">like so! (<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Covalent_H2O.png">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />In the end, the bonding function came to deal purely with atom behavior, i.e. atoms being moved about by the player and sticking together and then moving as one once they were "bonded." Atoms contained data about who their neighboring atoms were.  Validation took a single molecule, then compared the connections and neighbors against a "validation code."<br /><br />So, if we had the case of H-O-H, we could make a "validation code" which would contain data about the correct neighbors of each atom -- in this case, <code>h_o1-o_h2-h_o1</code>, which meant "a hydrogen with 1 oxygen neighbor, an oxygen with 2 hydrogen neighbors, a hydrogen with 1 oxygen neighbor."<br /><br />It worked :D And it meant that atoms could be bonded in any order, yay!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZWKDaDp6U4k/TVysvYL3ycI/AAAAAAAAAHc/Mgg9I_Hfu7Y/s1600/bondingtime_firstbond.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="238" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZWKDaDp6U4k/TVysvYL3ycI/AAAAAAAAAHc/Mgg9I_Hfu7Y/s320/bondingtime_firstbond.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />The game is <a href="http://neauro.com/flash/atomgame.swf">here</a>.  We've turned it in, but I can't help thinking of all the things that I would have wanted to change if we had more time... (.___.  I guess I can add it in the future.  Specifically:<br /><ul><li>put in some visual cue about which molecule is "selected" to bond (right now, the molecule which will get checked is just the last one clicked)</li><li>put in more visual cues about how electrons get shared between atoms (i.e. if two fluorine atoms get placed together, it should show that they both share one electron to bring each one's total number of valence electrons to 8)</li><li>put in more visual cues about the nature of bonds in a molecule (i.e. if it's a single or double bond)</li><li>put an undo button, for goodness sake; if someone makes a mistake right now, you just have to refresh the whole set of atoms on screen D:</li><li>better icons for bond/reset/skip functions (since according to <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em>, text labels on anything indicate poor design)</li><li>add more, and more interesting, atoms</li><li>add a bonus round of some sorts, where maybe the objective would be to just try and get as many atoms as you can bonded together...I don't know -shrug-</li></ul><br /><br /><br />...my very first game!  I'm still pretty proud. :D</div>

Haha, thanks. :D But c&#39;mon, you have done some pretty amazing stuff as well!  You do a ton more little experiments then I do, and have been learning about things for much longer!</div>

Wow, you actually did this? That&#39;s awesome. I wanted to do something like this back when I was taking chemistry classes. I feel like a loser who comes up with ideas and then never actually does them. You&#39;ve done all this cool stuff and found people to do them with.<br /><br />I congratulate you!</div>

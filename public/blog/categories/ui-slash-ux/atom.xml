<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IZKxZeym4hI/UnhNh5LTGHI/AAAAAAAAER8/ijPCNF5uWhM/s1600/pokemonxy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IZKxZeym4hI/UnhNh5LTGHI/AAAAAAAAER8/ijPCNF5uWhM/s640/pokemonxy.jpg" width="510" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">screenshots of the websites for Pokemon X &amp; Y<br />Japan (above), Netherlands (bottom)</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1">A couple weeks ago we analyzed the marketing sites for Pokemon X and Y across different countries. It turns out that all sites for Pokemon X and Y are the same — except for the one in Japan, which is shown at the top of the screenshot above.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">The differences between the Japanese site and the rest-of-the-world sites include:</div><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1"><br /></div><h4>Feature Descriptions</h4><div>Non-Japanese sites contain more information about the game, for example, direct links to features like the Pokemon Global Link; on the Japanese site, these are internal.</div><div><br /></div><div><h4>Hype</h4><div>Non-Japanese sites feature a large image carousel on their homepage, which shows other features of the game, all shown to excite:&nbsp;<i>Discover the Might of Mega-Evolved Pokemon! A New World of Amazing Pokemon!</i></div><div><i><br /></i></div><div>In contrast, the front page of the Japanese site merely says:&nbsp;<i>Pokemon, heading to a brand new dimension</i>! (Referring, I think, to the 3D?)</div></div><div><br /></div><div><h4>Obvious Marketing</h4><div>Non-Japanese sites contain immediate links to buy the game, as well as the 3DS; the Japanese site does not. (According to Julius, the 2DS isn't even available in Japan, perhaps because "Everyone there already has a 3DS!")</div></div><div><h4><br /></h4><h4>JavaScript</h4><div>The Japanese site has very little Javascript, and each page looks to be straight HTML. Additionally, text is often baked straight into the images, rather than being left as straight text, which is often the case in websites due to accessibility issues. (Text on images cannot be easily parsed by screenreaders. Some users also prefer to render text on websites to be more readable, for example, through the excellent&nbsp;<a href="http://www.beelinereader.com/">BeeLine</a>&nbsp;app.</div></div><div><br /></div><div><h4>Description vs. Instruction</h4><div>The Japanese site is more descriptive of the story and characters of the game; the non-Japanese site is more instructive of how to play the Pokemon game.</div></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div class="p1">We chalked up the majority of the differences the fact that Pokemon is more popular in Japan; Japanese game-players may not need to be particularly taught about Pokemon, or persuaded to buy it. But, this exercise makes me more interested in other facets of Japanese web design. Why is there so much baked-in text, why aren't there fancy hover menu states, why is the design so flat compared to the chrome and bevels of the non-Japanese sites? Is web accessibility less important in the Japanese corner of the internet, or is it handled in a way that's different in the US?</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">One final note: out class lecture that week was done by Kate Edwards, current Executive Director of IGDA, who shared some cool stories regarding the "culturization" problems she's encountered when helping to ship games across international borders. Something she noted was that, in the Netherlands, "adult" games don't need to be localized into Dutch because the adults there prefer to play the games in English. So, the fact that the Pokemon X and Y site text is all written in Dutch…</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><br /><div class="p1">…well…you can totally still enjoy the world of Kalos as a grown-up grad student with a full-time job. Just saying!</div></div>

The light lines, the title <i>beneath </i>the input — it's weird — it's like the hospital or government forms that I always take two of whenever I need to fill one out, because I always put my address and phone number in the wrong box.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">This is the sort of impediment you feel only at first glance, maybe. I hitched for a couple minutes but now I get it. However, with the previous bookmarklet, I liked that "tags" was a huge box, and I could click anywhere within it to start input. Now I have to click either the invisible input box, or the light "tags" title. (Though I notice now that when you hover over tags, it does darken the input line somewhat.)<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PY693rjnR4A/UkMR-Zp9rcI/AAAAAAAAELg/O7obxicF4GI/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-09-25+at+Wed%252C+Sep25%252C+2013+1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="566" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PY693rjnR4A/UkMR-Zp9rcI/AAAAAAAAELg/O7obxicF4GI/s640/Screen+Shot+2013-09-25+at+Wed%252C+Sep25%252C+2013+1.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">screenshot of bookmarklet "home" view</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Another improvement to the bookmarklet: before, after saving a link to Delicious, the pop-up turned completely white and there was no indication that your link was saved successfully. This time, you see a small version of your Delicious homepage, with your newly-saved link at the top. This still doesn't give you feedback if you open the bookmarklet on an already-saved page and alter tags or comments, however.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">In other news, this review on <i><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/200648/Opinion_The_tragedy_of_Grand_Theft_Auto_V.php">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> </i>by Leigh Alexander is great.</div></div>

    <updated>2013-02-26T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://neauro.github.io/liwanag/blog/2013/02/26/lift-app</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
I tried using <a href="http://lift.do/">Lift</a> for a while. Having read <a href="http://zenhabits.net/sticky/">ZenHabit</a>'s encouragement that the way to start a habit is by just <em>starting</em>, even if it's a little bit at a time, I thought Lift would be a good (and pretty) way to keep myself accountable. I rearranged my iPod home screen, putting it on my front page's top row. I dutifully added three habits that I wanted to keep track of: getting exercise, writing, and more writing.<br /><br />Two things broke Lift for me.<br /><br /><strong>First — You can't go back to previous days to mark what habits you did, but didn't mark that day.</strong> Or maybe you can, and I just couldn't figure out how? In any case, I have an iPod — I'm not connected to the internet through it every day — and stressing myself out by making sure I log into Lift at least once a day is something I'm not willing or happy to burden my completionist personality with.<br /><br /><strong>Second — ultimately, Lift isn't meaningful enough to me.</strong> Though I'm working on getting both exercise and writing time, actually doing those things is the feel-good reward, and Lift doesn't add to these feelings in any interesting way. Even with Tiny Tower, logging in once a day to mindlessly tap things gives you, eventually, an impressive tower. All Lift could do for me was represent my taps as a series of colored bars and occasionally send some canned inspirational e-mails.<br /><br />On a side note, it is fun to read Lift's blog and see data compiled about people's <a href="http://blog.lift.do/post/40128965086/infographic-your-goals-in-2013">2013 goals</a>, or other ways that people are using <a href="http://blog.lift.do/post/42988396863/lift-tip-rewards-for-good-habits">extrinsic awards</a> to keep themselves sticking to habits that I think are easy to justify yourself out of, such as not staying late at work.</div>

Yeah! It does make me wonder about the life cycle of this sort of app though. It seems to make itself obsolete by the success of its users (assuming success is defined by gaining intrinsic happiness). Then again, I suppose you could say that about a lot of things (like dating sites :P).</div>

If you&#39;ve gotten started and now actually doing your habits is your reward, then I&#39;d say you probably don&#39;t need Lift at this point anyway. :)</div>

<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nXd9sMOxHqU/UFJQ7rduSvI/AAAAAAAACgc/O4B38ms78ss/s1600/pinterest.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="354" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nXd9sMOxHqU/UFJQ7rduSvI/AAAAAAAACgc/O4B38ms78ss/s640/pinterest.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">screenshot of my pinterest page</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />At some point I thought Pinterest was The Greatest Thing, but&nbsp;then a week or two passed and I found it pretty forgettable. Compared to Tumblr, it's something that fell short of my "<a href="http://www.nirandfar.com/2012/09/habit-zone.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NirAndFar+%28Nir+and+Far+Blog%29">habit zone</a>," maybe because I felt less of a community there, or because the cascading photos serve so much better the action of basking in the beauty of something for three seconds before moving onto the next Amazing Thing That I Want to Try (like <i><a href="http://www.17apart.com/2012/02/how-to-grow-green-onions-indefinitely.html">growing green onions indefinitely</a>, WHOA</i>. Though, apparently the onions only last about 3 or 4 more chops, and get pretty bland). Compare to Tumblr, where the single-column feed of media encourages you to stay, and to read, and to discuss, at least a <i>little</i>&nbsp;longer.<br /><br />Something that Pinterest has about Tumblr is the sense of organization -- my storage of links on Tumblr just gets larger and longer and harder to parse, especially with the overhead of adding tags (which may not match tags I already made, and which I might not have added at all, out of laziness). In contrast, organization in the form of boards is Pinterest's foundation, and it also very easily keeps tracks of images and their source links for you. It's also easy to skim even huge piles for what you want, or easy to just skim them with a smug sense of satisfaction at your gathered knowledge.<br /><br />Pinterest! The best way to visually organize cross-platform bookmarks in a way that makes you feel as productive as if you had actually been doing all the DIY things you're marking to do Later.</div>

<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0isCSiBChlI/UCKf81WqqtI/AAAAAAAAB6Q/HKSB_hFA4LI/s1600/vm-book.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0isCSiBChlI/UCKf81WqqtI/AAAAAAAAB6Q/HKSB_hFA4LI/s320/vm-book.jpg" width="246" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">cover of visual merchandising (<a href="http://idowindows.wordpress.com/2010/02/05/visual-merchandising-by-tony-morgan/">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote><i>A great introduction for retail students, this book offers a user-friendly reference guide to all aspects of visual merchandising and covers both window dressing and in-store areas. Using examples from a range of stores from fashion emporia to supermarkets, the book offers practical advice on the subject, supported by hints and tips from established visual merchandisers. It reveals the secrets of their tool kit, and information on the use of mannequins, the latest technology, how to construct and source props, and explains the psychology behind shopping and buyer behavior. </i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Presented through color photographs, diagrams of floor layouts, and store case studies, and including invaluable information such as a glossary of terms used in the industry, Visual Merchandising is an essential handbook for anyone working in and learning about this exciting area.</i></blockquote><br />This came up as a hit when I searched the public library database for books about stores and merchandising, which I was in turn searching for as a resource for free-to-play game design. <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/06/11/154787321/game-maker-stunted-by-facebook-turns-to-mobile">As NPR uncovered</a>, free-to-play games are a lot like stores; you see the nice displays outside, shuffle in and around for a while, and if you discover something that you like, something that will, perhaps, make you feel like a better human being, you pay money to obtain that thing.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.electricrest.com/wordpress/?p=376">Electric Rest</a> details some other possible applications of store design to free-to-play games, and I thought I would try and find some myself.&nbsp;<i>Visual Merchandising </i>turns out to be something of a beautiful textbook, with a history of window displays that in Olden Times (a.k.a. early 1900s) displayed not fashionable&nbsp;manikins, but rotating displays of art and sometimes curiosities (like a plane that had fallen while attempting to cross the Atlantic, and was promptly reassembled in a department store window).<br /><br />With regards to a digital medium, the takeaways are a little harder to come by, though I guess you could force them out. For example, indoor arrangements depend on the store's architecture, but there are a couple rules of thumb that help, such as "shelves that are angled rather than parallel to each other can draw people in to explore." Could an interface be designed in such a way that the eye is drawn to viewing other goods for sale, rather than relying on a "Go to next page" click? How could you fashion an experience that allows someone to wander aimlessly, yet also not impede them if they want to get directly to Point B?<br /><br />The three-dimensional space and atmosphere afforded by a store can be impactful in ways that I think are hard to mirror to video games, or even shopping websites. There's the three-dimensionality, of course, and the impact of sound and other people and smells set to artificially make you feel like you're in a warm tropical clothing paradise ripe for bikini buying. Also, even though I'm sure people are aware of the fact that stores try and push cheap gum and parcels of assorted high fructose corn syrup at you as you're paying for your Actual Purchases, I think it's easy to write off a lot of store design as "Oh, they did that just because that's the way the store is shaped, not because they're <i>trying&nbsp;desperately to sink their hands into my wallet.</i>" Contrast to perpetual social game pop-ups rewarding you with discounts on virtual goods.<br /><br />Another thing that&nbsp;I believe stores will have going for them for a while is their ability to support social exploration, to serve as a bauble-filled backdrop to people's wanderings as they share each other's company. I can't think of any games that do similar. (Though I suddenly imagine some WoW- or Second Life-esque scenario...ah, well, you could imagine an MMORPG fitting into <i>any</i> scenario, though.)<br /><br />In short: <i>Visual Merchandising</i> has gorgeous photos, some interesting history and details about things like department stores and manikins, and so on. It also features some ~*famous window displays*~ like the one from Selfridge's which has all those inflatable boobs...what does it look like? Read the book!<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div></div>

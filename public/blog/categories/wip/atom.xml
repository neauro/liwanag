For example, the following is wrong:<br /><br /><pre class="brush: html"><script src="game.js"></script> <!-- "WHERE IS #CANVAS" --><br /><canvas id="canvas"></canvas><br /></pre><br />In trying to do collision stuff, I also ran into a curious problem where the following did not work:<br /><br /><pre class="brush: js">if ( ((that.X-that.radius) &lt;= (player.X+player.width)) &amp;&amp;<br />(that.Y &gt;= player.Y) &amp;&amp;<br />(that.Y &lt; (player.y+player.height)))<br />collided = PADDLE;<br /></pre><br />But this <em>did</em>:<br /><br /><pre class="brush: js">var hit_paddle_side = beneath_paddle_top = above_paddle_bottom = false;<br /><br />if (((that.X-that.radius) &lt;= (player.X+player.width))) hit_paddle_side = true;                 if ((that.Y &gt;= player.Y)) beneath_paddle_top = true;<br />if ((that.Y &lt; (player.Y+player.height))) above_paddle_bottom = true;<br /><br />if (hit_paddle_side &amp;&amp; beneath_paddle_top &amp;&amp; above_paddle_bottom)<br />    collided = PADDLE;<br /></pre><br />Not sure why yet.<br /><br />All the code is <a href="https://github.com/neauro/html5pong">on my Github</a> for now.</div>

&quot;Hamburger-style&quot; as in, the opening of the notebook going horizontally instead of vertically!  Though now that you mention it, I learned that phrasing in kindergarten for folding 8x11 sheets of paper.  I wonder if it really can be applied to notebooks...</div>

I haven't done <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> before because it's an event that seems to me to stress quantity over quality, and if there's something that I know I've been doing since I was in junior high, it's writing a lot.  I have hundreds of pages of 8.5pt Verdana Word Documents, for a story that I would still consider myself in the process of writing, though it's undergone pretty drastic changes since back then (most of them for the good).  My old .doc files that contain culled stuff (just in case) is longer than the actual story itself.  I mean, I started writing a <em>sequel</em> to this story before it was even finished.  (O you eighth grade self!)<br /><br />So, I don't usually feel accomplished if I reach a certain count of words.<br /><br />That being said, I don't usually feel accomplished either if I don't write anything at all, so in between work, school, and bouts of Magic I've been chipping away at my own NaNo.  I've fallen a bit behind but am certain I can catch up over Thanksgiving break.<br /><br />...but only if I can't get a copy of Skyward Sword. o___o<br /><br />The story itself is set in Anthem, the of my semi-inactive <a href="http://opalitewires.blogspot.com/">Opalite Wires</a> writing practice blog thing.<br /><br />Here are the first two paragraphs:<br /><br /><blockquote>In Quartzal, the gravity was a little lighter than usual.  This is why it was the main Lower Anthem district for the passerine, who find their flight more easily won in the skies there; a few powerful rows and you’re off, unlike in lower districts where some passerine struggle or else don’t visit at all.  A favorite tagline for passerine tourist was that in Quartzal, one’s wings often open by themselves, which indeed seems to be the case, especially in narrow restaurants where this sort of abrupt twitch can be taken very poorly.  The most popular restaurant in Quartzal served soup comprising a variety of things harvested from the explored regions of Anthem (fungus from Slatemet, cuttles from Obsidash, lightning from Tonsor) in tiny pots balanced on the backs of salamanders, who especially didn’t take kindly to abrupt movements.  Singed tongues, brows, and too much ruined furniture led the proprietors of that particular store to adopt a bound-wing policy, in which winged guests such as the passerine would be required to don a semi-attractive set of belts that had been repurposed to hold wings shut in the unfortunate but inevitable event that Quartzal’s mysterious lightness would force them open.<br /><br />It was one of the few places where rain was welcomed; for with the biannual season of downpours came a great amount of mud, which transformed choking crystalline dust into fine pearly mud that passersby were loathe to scrub from their vehicles, whether they were carriages or cycles or the long, equinal dragons that were the present fashionable mount of Quartzal’s earth-bound bipedal beings.  Rain that fell from beyond the perimeters of the district Quartzal was the only kind of liquid which would render the dirt of Quartzal in this way; water that had been stored in cisterns for the dry season would fail to bring about the same effect, as would water hauled from the lower oceans, as far below as Coralanem, where indeed someone had tried to harvest the water that loved its depth so much it would struggle against the vases of abductors with churning and hisses.  It had to be rain - rain fallen fresh and cool from the skies, water that had rested in the clouds for so long that it had forgotten everything but dozing in the breeze, sometimes calm, sometimes with fits.</blockquote></div>

Yeah!  I actually really wanted to make &quot;Her Will&quot; into a Flash platformer (http://neauro.com/content/writing/herwill/writing.pdf) but couldn&#39;t quite think of a good mechanic to build around.  You should let me know if you come up with any ideas!  I&#39;d be up for doing fun storygame stuff outside of normal work.</div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
The other day I tried applying to a job through the Amazon Careers website, and the experience was pretty interesting.<br /><br />The normal Amazon Careers website has a frame to the right which is the container for search results and job details.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tiEdJuD-92M/TlSShbRW-4I/AAAAAAAAAXU/VASbkoT6w2I/s1600/amazon2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tiEdJuD-92M/TlSShbRW-4I/AAAAAAAAAXU/VASbkoT6w2I/s640/amazon2.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">aww yeah. &nbsp;so much opportunity for employment</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Hjc2SGREjoo/TlSSmNRiiBI/AAAAAAAAAXc/r6P_kWXshuo/s1600/amazon3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="346" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Hjc2SGREjoo/TlSSmNRiiBI/AAAAAAAAAXc/r6P_kWXshuo/s640/amazon3.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">the first listing</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Unfortunately for me at the time, I was given a direct link to an internship which filled up the entire page.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FQD3hDyeSd0/TlSYFVqLdtI/AAAAAAAAAYE/v_ascKp2iqA/s1600/amazon22.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="358" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FQD3hDyeSd0/TlSYFVqLdtI/AAAAAAAAAYE/v_ascKp2iqA/s640/amazon22.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">does the font need to be that small?</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I think the link itself is deprecated because I couldn't find the job by searching through Amazon Careers, but I didn't know this at the time. And the last time I tried to apply for a job to Amazon before this was a couple months ago, so I already had a profile, albeit completely unrelated to the position that I was applying for now.  Still, I pressed "Apply Now," thinking that I could change that information before submitting.<br /><br />But the next page that showed up said, merely,<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FTpDjHR0C2c/TlSSxH52sVI/AAAAAAAAAXs/gJqwGgMfelY/s1600/amazon7%2B--%2Bstep%2B4.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FTpDjHR0C2c/TlSSxH52sVI/AAAAAAAAAXs/gJqwGgMfelY/s640/amazon7%2B--%2Bstep%2B4.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">wait...what about the first three steps?!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />"Step 4 of 4" could only mean "This is the last step before submitting your application," so I applaud the transparency of it. &nbsp;Still, for some reason I went and clicked through anyway, thinking that I'd still be able to change what irrelevant or old information that I had on file.  I didn't.  Ack!<br /><br />So I searched in haste for "My Account" to put in my application information. When I eventually found it It looks like this:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zp07gj5RBmI/TlSS07TDhJI/AAAAAAAAAX0/vzDs1gLiq5I/s1600/amazon5%2B--%2Byour%2Baccount.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zp07gj5RBmI/TlSS07TDhJI/AAAAAAAAAX0/vzDs1gLiq5I/s640/amazon5%2B--%2Byour%2Baccount.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">unexpectedly sparse</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The text is, to me, a little small for a page that has nothing else on it.  I guess it's easily remedied by just increasing the font size. &nbsp;(Also, is that a dangling list element?)<br /><br />The "Your Profile" page is similar.  This is where you fill in all the information that will be used to apply to whatever job at Amazon that you so desire.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6Wm2YVsUul4/TlSS67FYm4I/AAAAAAAAAX8/ETuOW4i4FfM/s1600/amazon6%2B--%2Byour%2Bprofile.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6Wm2YVsUul4/TlSS67FYm4I/AAAAAAAAAX8/ETuOW4i4FfM/s640/amazon6%2B--%2Byour%2Bprofile.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">this is everything Amazon needs to know about you.<br />name, address, and the last three degrees you earned (not pictured)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />So then I uploaded my profile, and...what? &nbsp;I'm still not quite sure whether the updated information is being used for the application that I had already submitted.  I imagine that it is, but even so, a confirmation would be nice.<br /><br />These are the things that I wish had been different about this process in general:<br /><ul><li><strong>I want to see what information you're submitting to a job</strong>.  Or, at least, a recap of what steps 1, 2, and 3 had been before I went through step 4.  Even now, months after first creating my account, I can't reconstruct what the previous steps would have been.  "Sign up, Fill in Information, Find Job and Apply?"</li><li><strong>I want the ability to apply to jobs that are completely different in nature.</strong>  In particular, I wish that I had been able to submit different resumes to different jobs, or that I could provide a cover letter for each one.  (I normally hate writing cover letters, but this position in particular was one that I enjoyed writing a cover letter for.  Ah, wasted effort!</li><li><strong>I want less fields about what school you went to on your Profile page</strong>.  How many applicants does Amazon have every day that have been to <em>three</em> post-high school schools?  Are there enough to justify making <em>everyone</em> go through filling this spaces in?</li><li><b>I want a notification about selection or non-selection of a position.</b>&nbsp; The whole process is pretty automatic-feeling anyway, so having a confirmation e-mail that an application was selected, or an e-mail gently letting down your hopes would be nice, haha.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><div>As a note, in order to get the "Step 4 of 4" screenshot I pretended I was applying to another arbitrary job, and the application still went through though I pressed "back" rather than the final "Submit." Out of curiosity, I just checked its status on the "Your Account" page.</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7DiZd3KoYPo/TlSV-PsCDwI/AAAAAAAAAYA/Mmc4a0s_LYQ/s1600/amazon8.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="358" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7DiZd3KoYPo/TlSV-PsCDwI/AAAAAAAAAYA/Mmc4a0s_LYQ/s640/amazon8.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">it reads, <i>Reviewed, Not Selected.</i><br />oh well, i guess</td></tr></tbody></table><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Which makes me think:</div><div><ul><li>Wow, someone reviewed my application fast!</li><li>Or else the computer just read through my resume quickly and tossed it out?</li><li>Wait, why are the other positions I applied to not showing up? &nbsp;Did my real application not actually go through? &nbsp;Or does this status thing just expire after a week or so?</li><li>Also, why does my application for the Design Intern position still say that my application is already on file, when this page obviously doesn't have it listed?</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>In conclusion: I have a weird feeling that people don't really get jobs through career websites, but through career fairs and internal connections, so I suspect the entire site is just a front anyway, haha.<br /><br /><b>Edit:</b>&nbsp;Oh! &nbsp;I did receive an automated "We received your application!" e-mail for the job I arbitrarily applied to just to obtain a screenshot. &nbsp;But it still reads "Reviewed, Not Selected" on the status page.<br /><br />¯\_(ツ)_/¯</div></div></div></div>

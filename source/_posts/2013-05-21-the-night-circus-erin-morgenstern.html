No announcements precede it. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not. Within the black-and-white striped canvas tents is an utterly unique experience full of breathtaking amazements. It is called </em>Le Cirque des Rêves<em>, and it is only open at night. <br /><br />But behind the scenes, a fierce competition is underway—a duel between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors. Unbeknownst to them, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will. Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into love—a deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands. <br /><br />True love or not, the game must play out, and the fates of everyone involved, from the cast of extraordinary circus per­formers to the patrons, hang in the balance, suspended as precariously as the daring acrobats overhead. <br /><br />Written in rich, seductive prose, this spell-casting novel is a feast for the senses and the heart.</em></blockquote><br />So <i>The Night Circus</i>&nbsp;was fantastic. Morgenstern's writing set such an atmosphere that wherever I read it I felt the black-and-white-striped tents rising all around me, the glow of closely-hanging lights.<br /><br />I've taken recently to thinking about books as made of three pillars — world-building, plot, and actual execution. <i>The Night Circus</i> was beautifully written, and set in a beautiful world. I felt the plot itself was a little lacking — the two main characters fall into love perhaps too easily — the Epic Battletimez seemingly promised by the cover description never really happen.<br /><br />But honestly, for me this was just fine. For a while <i>The Night Circus</i> cracked my head open and took me somewhere else, and it did a wonderful job of doing it.<br /><br />The design of the book was also gorgeous. Monochrome sunbursts! Little glowing flecks! It fit the mood of the book so well, and was sooo pretty.</div>

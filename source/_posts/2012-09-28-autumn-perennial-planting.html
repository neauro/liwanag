This past week has been busy with moving, the start of my new job, and the start of autumn quarter, but at some point we finally found time to plant the starters that we (well, I) bought (starry-eyed) at various nurseries.<br /><br />I've spent the past couple weeks reading books to raise my gardening level a little higher  before attempting The Real Thing. Library discoveries include <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046HAJ9K/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0046HAJ9K&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=nuubu-20">Talking Dirt</a></em> by Annie Spiegelman, and <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1604692200/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1604692200&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=nuubu-20">Decoding Gardening Advice: The Science Behind the 100 Most Common Recommendations</a></em>, by Jeff Gillman and Meleah Maynard. Both are incredibly readable and filled with great beginner information, especially for someone like me, who scarce knew the difference compost and mulch. Yes, they are different! And they do different things! Whoa! Both books are also incredibly forgiving and advise constant questioning of advice and continued experimentation and learning. So...here we go!<br /><br />Now knowing that "compost" is something which can be added to the dirt of places to make it all-around better for plant growth, we purchased some large bags and amended the beds around the back of the house, which (though covered appealing rich brown mulch) proved to be mostly rocky, pale dirt. Thereafter we planted some packets of seeds that seem to be ready to plant at about this time: overwintering carrots, swiss chard, spinach, cilantro. I am wary of seeds, especially since we just planted them straight in rather than growing them indoors beneath a light or something first, but I guess we'll see what happens with these.<br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_6POawL7UHs/UGaD1ijHJQI/AAAAAAAACh0/aF87yH46bF8/s1600/dirt.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="396" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_6POawL7UHs/UGaD1ijHJQI/AAAAAAAACh0/aF87yH46bF8/s640/dirt.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">dat compost</td></tr></tbody></table><br />We also transplanted <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/09/things-ive-learned-about-my-new.html">that blueberry bush</a>, which had -- since the time I bought it -- started exhibiting an alarming amount of yellowing leaves, as well as leaves that curled at their edges and became a pale brick-red color that was soft to the touch. Maybe scorch? Maybe a fungus? Maybe a canker? Maybe the effect of general nutrients or acidity leaking from its black gallon pot? In any case, we transplanted it into a corner of the beds with some scoops of azalea/rhododendron fertilizer to make up for any acidity the soil may not have, since I was a bad gardener and haven't checked the pH yet...I was too nervous of leaving it to wilt further in that container.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YCFJTyJfdXA/UGaD0vaYXQI/AAAAAAAAChk/UPMkWr-QYvY/s1600/blueberry.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="396" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YCFJTyJfdXA/UGaD0vaYXQI/AAAAAAAAChk/UPMkWr-QYvY/s640/blueberry.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">sorry, blueberry plant :(</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It's had some new young leaves since this last photo, which hopefully grew not just because of the burst of nitrogen in the fertilizer, which apparently can cause new growth that then just dies in winter because it isn't strong enough to withstand the cold. (Which is why fertilizers should be applied in spring, I suppose. Then again, another part of one of these books says it's best to plant perennials in autumn, when hot weather isn't there to stress them into not forming good roots...ahh!)<br /><br />One thing learned from these books is that, when buying perennials, it's better to choose a small, unblooming candidate. Small plants are better able to withstand transplanting, and if they don't yet have blooms, they can focus more of their energy on growing strong roots. It's also important to make sure that plants aren't&nbsp;root-bound,&nbsp;which can be checked by tipping the plant out of its pot and making sure the roots are white, not encircling the pot, and not smelly.<br /><br />Anyway, one of the new starters we got was a lemon balm.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-saSzMt32Ewk/UGaD2mNrhpI/AAAAAAAACiE/xUQsOrmTFUM/s1600/lemonbalm.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="396" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-saSzMt32Ewk/UGaD2mNrhpI/AAAAAAAACiE/xUQsOrmTFUM/s640/lemonbalm.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small; text-align: start;">lovely smelly smell</span></td></tr></tbody></table><br />Lemonbalm is part of the mint family, and is fragrant as all hell. You only need to touch the stems or leaves to have your hands come away with an inexplicably lemony and lovely aroma. It's apparently quite easy to take care of (even to the point of growing flush with more pruning?). For now it's by the front door so that we can grope it every time we leave.<br /><br />Beside it is a rosemary because of course.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FttRcXtdwa8/UGaD3WJ-MKI/AAAAAAAACiM/qvViGHxF1Gs/s1600/rosemary.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="396" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FttRcXtdwa8/UGaD3WJ-MKI/AAAAAAAACiM/qvViGHxF1Gs/s640/rosemary.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">like duh</td></tr></tbody></table><br />They're hardy enough that they grow on sidewalks here, tempting passersby to take a sprig despite the likelihood of such a sidewalk denizen having been&nbsp;anointed&nbsp;with pesticides or (worse) dog pee. In any case, rosemary always struck me as an uncomplaining garden occupant with the advantage of yielding omelette-friendly seasoning.<br /><br />Beside <em>that</em> is a stout chocolate mint, which some years ago I had tried to grow on a windowsill, to no avail. These seem a bit more sturdy than my previous twig of a chocolate mint, so here's hoping the mint family is as vigorous as people complain about, and can withstand my less-than-masterful attempts to support its survival.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-C0zBJTfrP38/UGaD1BZFGbI/AAAAAAAAChs/xrVn2y7n1bM/s1600/chocomint.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="396" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-C0zBJTfrP38/UGaD1BZFGbI/AAAAAAAAChs/xrVn2y7n1bM/s640/chocomint.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">good luck, little one</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The last plant we planted in was an agatasche, or "hummingbird mint," which can possibly attract hummingbirds, if they indeed exist here.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6qsoAsvB9eQ/UGaD0G7GYwI/AAAAAAAAChc/WHtiv-L-F-k/s1600/agastache.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="396" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6qsoAsvB9eQ/UGaD0G7GYwI/AAAAAAAAChc/WHtiv-L-F-k/s640/agastache.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i think i saw one here once?</td></tr></tbody></table><br />In general it was an attractive enough plant that I decided to forego my want of only edible gardening plants to obtain it. Presently it's planted in the bed around the monkey-tail tree, which makes me a little nervous since one of the things these books said was, <em>Don't raise a garden around the trunk of the tree!</em> This can apparently smother the roots there, and can lead to a greater chance of diseases or fungi attacking the tree. I believe that this garden was placed around the tree to make the house look pretty before we moved in, but Andou doesn't think that it's large enough to really harm the tree. I hope so, because the tree is so large and beautiful that it would be a shame if it died...<br /><br />So, yeah, anyway, to be honest I didn't really check the rootbounded-ness of any of these perennials, nor am I entirely sure, having already planted them, whether they were overly-rootbound or not...but as of this morning they were still alive, so, that's good.<br /><br />While digging up the front beds to place in new plants, we ended up unearthing some mysterious bulbs which look a lot like garlic but may not be. Planted here by previous tenants perhaps? Some of them were sadly crushed, but I'll re-plant them once the earth cools down a little and I'm ready to plant some tulips I received as a gift.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Hi_JALLdVAI/UGaD2Bn8rCI/AAAAAAAACh8/7rwT0jBdT6E/s1600/garlic.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Hi_JALLdVAI/UGaD2Bn8rCI/AAAAAAAACh8/7rwT0jBdT6E/s640/garlic.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">we'll see what occurs later</td></tr></tbody></table><br /></div>

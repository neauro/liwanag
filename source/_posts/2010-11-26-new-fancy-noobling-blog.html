<div class='post'>
My favorite thing to do is start projects, particularly those that involve huge copious amounts of writing, so it stands to reason that I've been wanting for like forever to make a blog in which I could attempt making pro conversation/discussion with myself about things that I want to learn/practice/improve upon in general.<br /><br />My project threads are as follows:<br /><ul><li><strong>Red Moleskine:</strong> For whatever form inspiration strikes in, including abruptly making some observation about the weather, drawing up a database schema for a web app (that I found out has already been done), sketching out shiba inu people, etc. etc.</li><li><strong>Spotty Daiso Notebook:</strong> For taking note of the myriad of programming/software-design related things that I have no idea about, so that I actually look them up later; also, to keep track of tasks for school research projects</li><li><strong><a href="opalitewires.blogspot.com">Opalite Wires</a>:</strong> For practicing writing something completely uncalled for every single day</li><li><strong>Normal Blog:</strong> Also for practicing writing something completely uncalled for every single day, but also for purposes of coming back months later to ooze nostalgically over whatever I wrote the previous year and see whether I'm still friends with the people that I talked about</li></ul>This makes for tons of ideas that are all over the place, and ANYWAY, the point is that, the objective of <em>this</em> blog is: to try and consolidate, into a relatively intelligible way, all the things that I do in all the other threads.<br /><br />IT WILL MAKE SENSE WHEN THERE'S MORE THINGS.</div>

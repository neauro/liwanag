The book is basically a series of animals and evolutionary characteristics, followed by a small "implications for design" section.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">For example, the book points out that sharks rarely have barnacles and bacteria on their skin, something that other fish and whales often have. This is because sharkskin is too rough and prickly to support such creatures easily, and this inspired the manufacture of a texture which could be stuck to things like doorknobs, and reduced the number of bacteria growing there <i>purely by texture alone</i>. <i>Whoa.</i></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><i><br /></i></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Another part of the book talked about how the pattern made by fallen leaves was always beautiful. I read it once again, thinking, <i>Wait, really? What the hell could this inspire design-wise</i>, and lo, it actually inspired <i>carpet which could look good no matter what direction its tiles were placed in.</i>&nbsp;I guess some patterned carpet needs to get laid in a certain order in order to look right, and there's some 17% cut-off in such carpet when the laying-down goes awry -- but with randomly-patterned carpet, there was only 2% cut-off! Wat!</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">There were many more creatures and plants that inspired different awesome designs, and it reminded me of <a href="http://cleantechnica.com/2011/08/21/13-year-old-gets-patent-for-efficient-solar-power-panel-array/">that kid who looked at trees and then got a patent</a> for his solar panels arrays, which were arranged in a spiral like the branches of a tree and were able to collect 20% or more energy than normal panels. &nbsp;Damn nature, u smart though.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I hope I'm not missing out on too much nature intelligence by keeping my head in books like this all the time.</div></div>

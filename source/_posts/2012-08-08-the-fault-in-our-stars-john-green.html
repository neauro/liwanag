And even though she could live for a long time (whatever that means), Hazel lives tethered to an oxygen tank, the tumours tenuously kept at bay with a constant chemical assault. <br /><br />Enter Augustus Waters. A match made at cancer kid support group, Augustus is gorgeous, in remission, and shockingly to her, interested in Hazel. Being with Augustus is both an unexpected destination and a long-needed journey, pushing Hazel to re-examine how sickness and health, life and death, will define her and the legacy that everyone leaves behind.</i></blockquote><br />I finished this book in an evening and a morning. It is fantastic. <a href="http://meloukhia.net/2012/03/book_review_the_fault_in_our_stars_by_john_green.html">A review on this ain't livin</a>&nbsp;sums it up more nicely than I feel I could: "<i>The Fault In Our Stars</i> basically took every cancer kid trope and shat on it, hilariously and sensitively and brilliantly."<br /><br />s.e. smith continues:<br /><blockquote><i>The Fault In Our Stars</i> is a book that makes cancer funny, that pokes fun at cancer, that points out the absurdity of life and shows you that it’s okay to be, and feel, ridiculous while dealing with chronic illness at the same time that it can also be funny, and frustrating, and enraging, and depressing. It’s a far cry from the usual sombre texts about cancer or the media that suggest cancer patients need to crack jokes for the benefit of the people around them. The dark humour is about insider’s jokes: It’s for people with cancer, not for others. It’s funny if you’ve been chronically ill, and isn’t intended to amuse caregivers and family and friends, although some may well find it funny too.<br /><br />It’s also a book that unflinchingly faces tragedy without turning maudlin and ridiculously sentimental. The Fault In Our Stars points out that the facts of life are often really, really crappy. For a man dedicated to reducing world suck levels, I like that Green pointed out that sometimes, world suck levels are out of our control, and that some of the narratives for dealing with that are deeply unhelpful and unuseful.</blockquote>Sometimes the characters' dialogue reminded me of something out of <i>Juno, </i>a little long and strewn with witticisms, but this stuff struck me less as "Man this is so implausible :(" and more as "This is so much fun to read, why am I suddenly laughing <i>and</i>&nbsp;crying :):"<br /><br />Another (weird, flinchy) plus for me: Hazel has two friends that are guys. And yet.&nbsp;<i>A love triangle does not happen.</i><br /><br />What else can I say about it? Things happened. Characters did stuff. Most importantly, everything that happened had weight. Go read it already!</div>

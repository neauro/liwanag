This time the theme was *Monster* and for this story I have to admit that I was heavily inspired by *Howl's Moving Castle* and *Shadow of the Colossus*. <a href="https://twitter.com/couch_crusader">Chris</a> helped me come up with a name for my main character, though I hope that name isn't *too* obvious.

I'm still working on a place to host my writing online. For now, if you're in Seattle, you can pick up a copy at Bulldog News!

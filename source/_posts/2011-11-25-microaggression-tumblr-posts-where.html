<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-autJ8MAz2pM/TtATfLf6kxI/AAAAAAAAAiE/tvosQ4dr8iw/s1600/justbeinadork.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-autJ8MAz2pM/TtATfLf6kxI/AAAAAAAAAiE/tvosQ4dr8iw/s640/justbeinadork.png" width="502" /></a></div><br />I feel like I run into a lot of posts on Tumblr which have this formula:<br /><br /><ol><li>Find picture of a girl posing "attractively" near a nerd-related thing; ex. a girl placing her cheek next to a game controller or TCG item and staring into the camera</li><li>Reblog, with a photo of yourself contorting your face next to a nerd-related thing</li></ol><div><br /></div><div>It's meant to be funny, but I think the underlying humor of this joke is related to these idea that girls shouldn't be showing themselves off to people. (Sluts!)</div><div><br /></div><div>Part of the funny may relate to the assumption that this girl is using cards to appear "nerdy," which is nowadays "<a href="http://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/i-am-a-female-nerd-apparently/">a new stereotype of femininity</a>." You can't tell that this is the case from a single picture. &nbsp;I mean, how could you rationalize it? &nbsp;<i>This girl doesn't really like Yu-Gi-Oh! cards! &nbsp;She's just showing off!</i>&nbsp; Yeah! &nbsp;Go sit back in your corner and where no one can see you, shoo! &nbsp;Only then can you <i>really </i>be a True Nerd.</div></div>

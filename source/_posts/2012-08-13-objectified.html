The film is directed by Gary Hustwit. Objectified premiered at the South By Southwest Festival on March 14, 2009. </i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectified" via="via" wikipedia="wikipedia">(via Wikipeda)</a></blockquote><br /><i>Objectified </i>has been languishing on my Netflix Instant Queue for the good part of a year or so. I finally watched it, and was glad! The film brings together a variety of designers from Across the World, who all talk about what they personally feel is Good Design. It's refreshing to watch designers talk so passionately about chairs and personal marks on the world and shaving away at the superfluous "fat" of a toothbrush design until they eliminate the concept of a toothbrush from oral health completely. It's amusing to see one designer swear that he's always "lived in the future," while another reaches into the past for <a href="http://davebmiller.wordpress.com/2010/06/10/spelunking-the-cell-phone/">a modern cellphone design inspired by childhood memories of peeling potatoes</a>.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br />In the end, I was relieved when the movie moved from "NEW THINGS! Aren't they cool? <i>Buy all these new cool things!</i>" to "Do we <i>really</i>&nbsp;need new cool things? I mean, just <i>look</i>&nbsp;at all the things that we already have."<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-20cHlJOlVXQ/UCKyaABIJSI/AAAAAAAAB8Y/f2sKV-TU3qE/s1600/2184_4.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="358" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-20cHlJOlVXQ/UCKyaABIJSI/AAAAAAAAB8Y/f2sKV-TU3qE/s640/2184_4.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">just...look at them (<a href="http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Objectified-Blu-ray/6861/">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The film points out the great problem of sustainability in product design, how it's not just about recycling/upcycling but how sustainability must guide design from before the beginning to beyond the end. <i>Why</i>&nbsp;are you designing this thing? What will it add to the world that doesn't already exist? And what will happen to the thing, when someone designs a new thing five seconds later?</div>

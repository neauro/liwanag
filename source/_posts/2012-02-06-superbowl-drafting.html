This past Superbowl Sunday a subset of ex-Dathouse roommates (plus me) got together, ate some chips, and had a draft!<br /><br />We went with three packs of Dark Ascension, which was a little "meh" since I feel unimpressed by DA rares. &nbsp;My first was a Fiend of Shadows that I passed up for a Lingering Souls. &nbsp;My second was Flayer of the Hatebound, and my third was Havengul Lich, which would have been<i>&nbsp;really</i>&nbsp;nice to open first....aahhh. &nbsp;As it was, I had already drafted green/red/white, which is what I find myself doing 90% of the time. &nbsp;(But man, can you imagine a deck revolving around Havengul Lich and Hatebound? &nbsp;That would have been so fun! &nbsp;Casting low-cost creatures from the graveyard just to deal damage with Hatebound...I'd even passed on a Curse of Bloodletting at some point.)<br /><br />I started off unreasonably salty because Andy at my right had picked up all the Immerwolves I had hoped to get, but I ended up finishing second (to Andy!). &nbsp;I had three Nearheath Stalkers and a couple Flings which (when equipped with an Executioner's Hood against a blue/black deck) put in the work.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HJlK3_DP4G0/TzDL7kJQ8GI/AAAAAAAAAo8/irHnIqXOBWA/s1600/nearheath-stalker.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="230" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HJlK3_DP4G0/TzDL7kJQ8GI/AAAAAAAAAo8/irHnIqXOBWA/s320/nearheath-stalker.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">have you ever looked closely at this art? &nbsp;it's terrifying (<a href="http://theroundtablet.com/2012/01/10/nearheath-stalker-by-michael-c-hayes/">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Since I didn't have the Immerwolves, I experimented splashing white for a Niblis of the Urn, a pair of Burden of Guilts, and a Curse of Exhaustion, which I just wanted to play with. &nbsp;I managed to get it out once, but not during any clutch games. &nbsp;At the end of it all, Andou noted that in draft people often spend a lot of their mana playing one heavy drop during their turn, rendering something like Curse of Exhaustion not as useful.</div>

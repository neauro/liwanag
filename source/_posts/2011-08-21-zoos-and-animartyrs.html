Chris came to visit!  And we visited San Francisco Zoo because I have wanted to and have not had buddies nearby that enjoy the act of going to the zoo enough to just go and bear with my taking pictures of everything.<br /><br />(Full set of zoo pictures is <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/sets/72157627363783575/">here</a>.)  This time, though, I didn't take hundreds of pictures like I normally do, probably because I've been to Woodland Park Zoo in the past couple months and because <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/07/raws-vs-jpeg-fine.html">I'm restricting myself to RAW now</a>, which means less space for pictures.  If I couldn't see anything but an animal's back then I usually just passed.  Being so conservative probably wasn't complete necessary since I had about 300/500 shots left at the end of the day, but, so it goes.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/6067715466/in/set-72157627363783575" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GGNwYYb04gM/TlHb4drP7hI/AAAAAAAAAWg/q8VB0E-92fY/s640/6067715466_3ef6295dd5.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">cool story bro</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Zoos are always kind of tough because on one hand, animals are great!  And on the other hand, these animals are trapped here in small exhibits, pacing and staring out the wires and sifting the mud over and over again for...what?<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/6067162379/in/set-72157627363783575" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qqxrQgcCFSg/TlHn_l76_GI/AAAAAAAAAWo/hPy6Ml2pT0s/s640/6067162379_8feebd51d0.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">something. &nbsp;anything</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The primates in particular always depress me, probably because they look so human.  And the flamingos by one of the dining areas would constantly spread their wings and then flap them all together, as if trying to rise up as one.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/6067159605/in/set-72157627363783575" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tyOUVqTHkxk/TlHsihF4QaI/AAAAAAAAAWw/TuGnzurGmXA/s640/6067159605_fd438f5edd.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">oh....right</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The zoo was, as usual, filled with children, trolling seagulls, nervously approaching goats at the petting zoo, listening vaguely as parents sometimes asked them questions about the world around them and taught them things about the animals that they read on the supplied placards by each exhibit.  Information everywhere; not like the internet, but for easy perusal relevant to the current circumstances of one's physical presence.  Eating lunch with Chris beside the flamingo pool, I looked down and saw that my burger was in a box lined with yet more information.  An explanation of why three of the nine subspecies of tigers are extinct.  Encouragements to eat organic and local.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5MfqMl1-fro/TlHu-lohGKI/AAAAAAAAAW0/LbBrqU3W5BE/s1600/200px-OmnivoresDilemma_full.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5MfqMl1-fro/TlHu-lohGKI/AAAAAAAAAW0/LbBrqU3W5BE/s400/200px-OmnivoresDilemma_full.jpg" width="263" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">ha! &nbsp;i see what you did there!<br />(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Omnivore's_Dilemma">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />I can't even think of any other places where people will happily go to be informed about something that is not really relevant to their everyday life, much less have a good chance of taking that information, finding it reasonable and un-offensive, and considering it, and acting upon it. &nbsp;Science museums are different, because everyone agrees <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2009-11-23/politics/obama.science_1_science-education-math-and-science-president-obama?_s=PM:POLITICS">science is good</a>; at the very least, someone would more easily agree to the idea that science is good, than to agreeing that "eating less meat is good," or "ensuring impoverished people are not exploited for our benefit is good."<br /><br />In any case, the quote in the Children's Zoo seemed pretty legit -- I don't remember it exactly, but in essence it went, "<em>Teach children how to love something and they will work to protect it</em>." The gorillas and the flamingos are martyrs.  The kid screaming at his half-finished Cheezit and bending down to pick it up and replace it in his mouth is a potential future warrior of the earth.</div>

...omg.  The human is cubicled in the zoo of society.  We are ALL unwilling martyrs.  But then for whose benefit is it?  Just our families and individual day-to-day survival?  Haha.</div>

Interesting point - I hadn&#39;t thought about zoos being a place where people go to be informed about something that&#39;s not directly relevant to them... Though maybe you could argue that almost all entertainment is like that. But you have picked out an important distinction, I think.<br /><br />Maybe they&#39;re martyrs, unwilling martyrs if that is even possible. The way I tend to think about it, which I realized a couple years ago at the zoo, is that these animals are no worse off than we are. The caged chimpanzee is to wild chimpanzee as the cubicled human is to prehistoric human. Better health care, perhaps, but everything else is so wrong. This is one reason why Avatar resonated with so many people, I think.</div>

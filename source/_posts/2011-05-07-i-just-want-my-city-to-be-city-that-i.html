Before it was just a dense cluster of Country Homes, which are the first tier of housing that you can buy, and thus is the building that is presently the most useless to me.  I need more population in less space!  But something about bulldozing houses for Milan Apartments or Upscale Condos is a little uncomfortable.<br /><br />My most recent additions to the city of Tummy are a cheese store and a candle shop, which are named Tummy and Whey, and The Tummy At Both Ends, respectively.<br /><br />Anyway.<br /><br />Last week or so I attended the first <a href="https://convore.com/seattle-indies/info/">Seattle [Game Dev] Indies meetup</a> at The Capitol Club, which I walked past twice before actually discovering.  Though I cannot comfortably call myself an "indie" game dev (unless you count my research projects and the burgeoning Get Across), I wasn't quite sure what my place was, but in general just wanted to learn more about the community and see what new experiences I could make.  Everyone was nice (though some were understandably horrified that I have not yet played Portal 2, nay, have not even played the first Portal), even <a href="https://twitter.com/danctheduck">Dan</a> for some reason remembered me from my stint helping him take surveys for his game two years ago, and I was super happy to run into <a href="http://evolutionlive.blogspot.com/">Alex</a> again.  I learned about the tragedy of <a href="http://thesiteformerlyknownas.zachtronicsindustries.com/?p=713">Infiniminer</a>, that a lot of people are making abstract music games, that <a href="http://flixel.org/">Flixel</a> is much more widely used than I thought, that <a href="http://playerio.com/">Player.IO</a> really <em>is</em> the way to go for multiplayer Flash games, which is good, because we finally finished paper prototyping stage and started coding Get Across.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-chd51p9HCUE/TcWGkCvpGuI/AAAAAAAAAM0/iGuChDQnJeo/s1600/playerio.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="74" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-chd51p9HCUE/TcWGkCvpGuI/AAAAAAAAAM0/iGuChDQnJeo/s320/playerio.gif" width="199" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">you the bestest</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Working with Player.IO has been really simple and fun, though it's taking a while for me to wrap my head around noSQL and the whole "We don't have rows, we have objects!" thing.  I want to learn more about noSQL.  Is it faster than relational databases?  IS it still a relational databases?!  Somehow an initial Google search was fruitless.<br /><br />Some advantages of Player.IO:<br /><ul><li>I would have had no idea how to implement network stuff otherwise, and the given code and examples make it relatively easy</li><li>GUI is really nice!</li><li>I can view every item in my database and alter each one? &nbsp;Wat!</li><li>Database queries are all asynchronous, which makes them fast</li></ul><br />And some problems we've run into:<br /><ul><li>There are three people in our team, and when we are all working together, one of us will sometimes hang at the "joining a room" dialogue</li><li>Running into vague "InternalError" problems when loading/updating the database is a pain...nothing to do for it but wait until something works all of a sudden :/</li><li>Database queries are all asynchronous, which makes it so I get results back at weird/wrong times</li></ul><br />Not deal-breakers overall, and I'm getting more and excited.

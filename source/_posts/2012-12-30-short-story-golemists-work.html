The inside of this quarter's edition is unexpectedly lovely. To check it out, you'll have to get it yourself, since I've tried and failed and subsequently quit attempting to make myself take pictures and upload them for this post.&nbsp;It's available on campus and neighboring book-related businesses until supplies run out. My particular story can also be accessed <a href="http://neauro.com/storything/golemist.html">here</a>, because I wanted some content to practice styling, and playing around with for lightweight parallaxing.<br /><br />[ spoilers ]<br /><br />Inspiration didn't quite strike me for any of the themes last year, but it did for this particular theme, "Homeland." I was feverishly thinking of ways to riff off the idea of <em>returning home</em> when I was shuffling my white/green tokens deck, and then looked down into my hand and saw Wayfaring Temple.<br /><br /><em>Oh my gosh</em>, I thought, <em>what if your home returns to YOU?</em><br /><em><br /></em>I used <a href="http://johnpolacek.github.com/superscrollorama/">SUPERSCROLLORAMA</a>&nbsp;for the sillyness at the end.</div>

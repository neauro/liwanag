Not so hard, as Charlie had already implemented the store-type setup, and I really just needed to change a couple variables here and there and add the right checks to make sure the avatars loaded properly.  The hardest thing was testing each little avatar and making sure that the frames were all separated -- if the images on the frames are too close together, then you can see bits of them leaking onto other frames of an animation.  There's probably a smarter way to figure out where the delineation is in Flixel sprite animations, but I haven't been able to find it yet.<br /><br />Hopefully this will make our Facebook release even just a little bit more fun/appealing.  FB release will happen at the latest this Thursday, if another team-member hasn't already pushed it.  Player.IO was apparently pretty easy to hook up to Facebook if you subscribe to Sitebox, which is a relief; I'm planning to get more details later on how exactly Charlie did it.</div>

Awesome, they are so cute! I forgot that you draw also. Maybe I&#39;ll have to get you to do the art on one of my games sometime. :)</div>

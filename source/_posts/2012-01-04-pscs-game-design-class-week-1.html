<div class='post'>
Yesterday I facilitated my first class at the <a href="http://pscs.org/">Puget Sound Community School</a> (PSCS). The class is called "Make Games: Design," and is a companion to Alex's "Make Games: Programming," previous iterations of which <a href="http://evolutionlive.blogspot.com/2010/10/teaching-flixel.html">written about before</a>.<br /><br />There are four boys in the class. I had been hoping to intrigue some girls into it, and during my pitch before the school kept eyeing the ones in the front row.  <i>Yeah!  Girls can play games too!  Check it ouuutt!  </i>In retrospect, I realize that I might have erred in my pitch by not mentioning that our discussions will not center around the intricacies of triple-A titles these girls may have never heard of, much less played. Saying that might have made the class seem more accessible. As it was, the kids that joined my class were all those that had been huddled in the back of the room on their laptops.<br /><br />Which isn't a bad thing; it just makes me wince a little to see a group of laptop kids completely girl-less.  Then again, girls don't all have to like computers.<br /><br />Anyway, the class was off to a good start.  My four students are incredibly bright and eager to participate in a way that's refreshing and relieving -- after all, I've myself been a part of a wordless classroom a teacher is trying to engage.  After introductions, I asked what everyone's favorite games were, and why.  By the end, we had talked about Portal 2, WoW, Skyrim, Skyward Sword, The Darkness, and they all had good keywords to say about the games -- things like, <i>This game was good because of its goals -- because of its progression -- because there's always brand new content -- because of good feedback...</i><br /><br />And, inversely, <i>This game [Skyward Sword] was bad because they had this whole world you could explore, except not really because all you could find were these treasure chests you couldn't even interact with...</i><br /><i><br /></i><br />Something that I heard too often for my taste were things like <i>This game is just AWESOME!</i>  Somehow one of them had convinced me to watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/AtM3PGyiQUc">the trailer for Metal Gear Solid 5</a> and I watched them salivate with a sort of horror.  Really?  <em>Really?</em><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8rlbB9C4rJk/TwvDScY1OII/AAAAAAAAAl8/dZI4u-KteLQ/s1600/mgs5.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="174" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8rlbB9C4rJk/TwvDScY1OII/AAAAAAAAAl8/dZI4u-KteLQ/s320/mgs5.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">this silver-haired bishounen is holding up a freshly-extracted spinal column</td></tr></tbody></table><br />My head resonates with<i> </i>something that sounds disturbingly like <i>Kids these days!  </i>But I can't let my heavy cynicism and bitter boredom with big-budget graphics-intensive gaming get in the way of talking about core design.  Which, though I only have about 9 hours to do it over the course of the next 9 weeks, I definitely want to do -- and if at the end of it these people appreciate games not just for their diamond fluff, but <i>also </i>because they understand their design and creation, I'll consider this experiment in facilitating a success.</div>

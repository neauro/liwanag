I've done a lot of exploring in San Francisco this past weekend, as my more city-savvy friends have returned from Japan.  One of them lamented having not known about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_image_format">raws</a> before going, and we had a conversation about it, with me mostly being like, <em>Dude, raw may make your pictures better but so does having the proper aperture, shutter speed, white balance, ISO,</em> etc.<br /><br />I've only tried shooting raw once, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=11378171@N02&amp;q=%22golden%20gardens%22">with somewhat non-exceptional results</a>.  The only thing that came out of this experience was that raws took forever to edit (on my poor, slow computer) and I didn't really see much difference in quality.<br /><br />Fast forward to exploration weekend, wherein I decided I would give raws another shot (if you will) and then realized that <em>they are really cool</em>.  There are <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/understanding-series/u-raw-files.shtml">other places</a> where you can learn exactly what raws are, so I won't go into that here, but rather just talk about my experiences.<br /><br />What I found really amazing about the raw images that I took was the capacity that I had to edit them.  With my normal fine jpegs, I pretty much just threw them into Photoshop, and adjusted the middle bar of Levels slightly to the right to get rid of some of the grays.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hQG8cREC90M/Ti5OEXhbfvI/AAAAAAAAATE/b3uwemzEG4g/s1600/lessgraylol.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="198" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hQG8cREC90M/Ti5OEXhbfvI/AAAAAAAAATE/b3uwemzEG4g/s320/lessgraylol.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">now it's less gray lol</td></tr></tbody></table><br />And that was about the extent of my editing, unless I was trying to fix white balance or whatever.  Occasionally I would touch the other two bars, but pictures would inevitably look way too bright or way too dark afterward.  Plus, editing was pretty linear -- stuff as a whole would just keep getting brighter (and way too bright), or else much darker.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P7Cj8Myg8VI/Ti5Op5X5iGI/AAAAAAAAATM/37N4R2Ll0eQ/s1600/lessgraylol2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="217" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P7Cj8Myg8VI/Ti5Op5X5iGI/AAAAAAAAATM/37N4R2Ll0eQ/s320/lessgraylol2.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">now it's more white lol</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Enter raws, which are apparently just like having an undeveloped shot of film, in which all its possibilities of exposure are retained.  Also enter the Conservatory of Flowers, which is what I did in order to take tons of pictures of flowers, despite the fact that flower picture-taking is uber-typical.  Here is my original photo of a flower --<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yEDrWjcps4w/Ti5Pdj-LUQI/AAAAAAAAATU/j7XaEkY1-HI/s1600/sunday72.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yEDrWjcps4w/Ti5Pdj-LUQI/AAAAAAAAATU/j7XaEkY1-HI/s320/sunday72.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />And here are two edited versions --<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br /></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_oo9KWAgCFM/Ti5PmQ47RyI/AAAAAAAAATc/mlRl2t_CTTI/s1600/sunday71.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="212" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_oo9KWAgCFM/Ti5PmQ47RyI/AAAAAAAAATc/mlRl2t_CTTI/s320/sunday71.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EuepuPwp_e4/Ti5PqbMa1UI/AAAAAAAAATk/wph0yhVEmK4/s1600/sunday73.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="212" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EuepuPwp_e4/Ti5PqbMa1UI/AAAAAAAAATk/wph0yhVEmK4/s320/sunday73.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><em>Where did all that detail come from?!</em><br /><br />Had I been editing a jpeg from that original, I assure you that the only thing I would have known how to do is make that shit even whiter than it already was.  Or else make everything around it as black as my soul.  Though I have to admit that a likely cause of this is just the fact that using Photoshop tools is like reaching for something in a huge, bubbling cauldron and slapping it on your picture -- you don't really know what you're doing and you're never really quite sure what will happen.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dtsf4qr3b74/Ti5RtKqc6dI/AAAAAAAAATs/Mg_gfs-UtA0/s1600/lolol.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dtsf4qr3b74/Ti5RtKqc6dI/AAAAAAAAATs/Mg_gfs-UtA0/s320/lolol.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">what wait oh no why</td></tr></tbody></table><br />On the other hand, the workflow for editing a raw in the Mac that I'm borrowing is pretty self-explanatory.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HDutWQ33XJ4/Ti5T4iYqylI/AAAAAAAAAT8/eQy32YMjnrI/s1600/cameraraw.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="211" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HDutWQ33XJ4/Ti5T4iYqylI/AAAAAAAAAT8/eQy32YMjnrI/s320/cameraraw.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">oh, so those are the things i can do?<br />and i can see what changes they make to the picture immediately?<br />okay.</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Anyway.  My notable observations on raw are as follows:<br /><br /><ul><li>Raw files take up too much dang space. &nbsp;My 4GB memory card can handle 1,500+ fine JPEGs like a badass. &nbsp;It can hold about 400 raws.</li><li>This means that my normal methods of "TAKE AS MANY PICTURES AS YOU CAN AND MAYBE THREE OF THEM WILL BE OKAY" won't work here.</li><li>Then again, the reason why I had to take so many pictures was because so many of them turned out irreversibly poor. &nbsp;And if I could <i>edit </i>them...</li><li>Even though it sucks to have less space, I don't actually mind it -- throughout this past weekend I found myself being more thoughtful about what pictures to take, and being more vicious about which ones to immediately delete if I didn't like them. &nbsp;It's not just memory that I need to take into account -- it's the fact that every picture I save will require some minutes of editing, which, in my busy busy day is worth &nbsp; a ton. &nbsp;I'm already two days behind in my&nbsp;<a href="http://neauro.tumblr.com/tagged/30_day_challenge">San Francisco Summer thing</a>&nbsp;I'm trying to do.</li><li>Being more thoughtful in the actual picture-taking process is, to me, a refreshing change.</li><li>Plus, in the actual editing I really feel more connected and appreciative of each picture, and thus more like I've actually accomplished something meaningful for myself, etc.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>That being said, aside from pictures which will be explicitly harvested for panorama purposes, I think I'm going to do my best to stick to raw file formats as a default from now on, the same way that I moved somewhat mysteriously from always-auto to always-manual settings. &nbsp;Still, I think it's important to have a handle on aperture/shutter speed/ISO and all that, since a raw file format can't fix blur. &nbsp;(That I know of.) &nbsp;And you know me, I'm liek totally super pro photog, so listen up.</div></div>

Now I want to try shooting in RAW! I quietly lolled at several sentences in this post.</div>

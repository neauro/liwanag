<a href="http://www.spryfox.com/">Spry Fox</a> recently released their game Triple Town on iOS!  It lags a bit and takes time to load, but it's a wonderful, addictive match-3-esque game.  It's freemium; the first thousand or so "steps" are free, and you can purchase more steps with coins you earn as you complete levels.  Or, you can purchase the game for $3.99 in the App Store.<br /><br />You match three "Grass" to make a "Bush;" three "Bush" to make a "Tree;" three "Tree" to make a "House;" and so on.  Bears emerge randomly and three of them, trapped between landscape features, become gravestones that coalesce into a "Church."  A starting board is a mostly-clear glade of grass and stones; successful boards are freckled with red-bricked civilization.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_Y2LY7M-xcQ/TzFgCE8mlvI/AAAAAAAAApE/7zu4Cj_O_LI/s640/blogger-image-1126259615.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_Y2LY7M-xcQ/TzFgCE8mlvI/AAAAAAAAApE/7zu4Cj_O_LI/s640/blogger-image-1126259615.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">a screenshot of Triple Town</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I remember testing a bit of this game at the first <a href="http://www.seattleindies.org/">Seattle Indies</a> meet-up, and hearing Dan Cook tell me about how TT is at its heart <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/danctheduck/status/168044325006086144">a tragedy</a>.  The world starts bare and green, and inevitably you fill it with your colonization, reducing native bears to treasure-yielding clusters of churches.  I both appreciate this level of depth and am uncomfortable with this limited level of engagement of the important, sad, and real history of imperialism which still oppresses people today.  In this game there is nothing but to be the colonizer.  There is no success reachable through means alternative to keeping bears exactly where you want them, preventing movement until finally they homogenize into something beneficial to you.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OFKgNppvbDc/TzFgCoQT5tI/AAAAAAAAApM/iOp5cEdbdg8/s640/blogger-image--987295304.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OFKgNppvbDc/TzFgCoQT5tI/AAAAAAAAApM/iOp5cEdbdg8/s640/blogger-image--987295304.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">occupy, bears!!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Games go on until the entire board is filed with items, at which point any bears you have become gravestones and your score is tallied. &nbsp;Even when you lose, you still come away with something, whereas your "opponent", the bears, will always die.<br /><br />It's a wonderful game,&nbsp;<i>just</i> a game, <i>just</i> a brown bear and a gray headstone. &nbsp;But it does make me aware that some people can simply enjoy this game for what it is, even muse of its tragedy, and never have to feel like it's their own.</div>

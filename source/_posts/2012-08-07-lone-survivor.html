Said building brims with epidemic-stricken people-turned-zombie-things and a variety of scenarios that invite you to question whether any of this is Actually Happening.<br /><br />Because I'm a "min-max" type of player, games like this can do a number on me; I hate wasting in-game time/flares/bullets/food rushing down zombie-filled corridors that yield only dead ends, and upon finding myself in this situation I usually beat a hasty ESC and restart the game. Survival horror's tendency to translate its protagonist's physical/mental health as a reddening vignette or extra panting animations bewilders me. <i>I want to be 100% all the time, damn it! Tell me exactly when I need 10 more points of food to be fully sane!</i><br /><br />The map is difficult to parse at first, but it expresses my favorite little detail; in darkness it remains in shadow, so that to read it easily you have to be under actual sources of light. (Whoa! So realistic!)</div>

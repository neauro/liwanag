Since all the rave reviews on it made it so that it was sold out immediately at normal prices and is now being sold for $75 new, <em>best impulse buy ever</em>.  Plus, it's the first new (which for me means it came out in the past year) game that I've bought since Persona 3.<br /><br /><span class="shh"><em>jock jock jock jock jock</em></span><br /><br />(spoilers, etc.)<br /><br />Even though I heard <a href="http://30ninjas.com/blog/999-9-hours-9-persons-9-doors-review-a-triumph-of-narrative">the story was pretty good</a>, I was completely unprepared for HOW COMPLETELY AMAZING IT WAS.  All of the characters, despite being pretty average for an anime cast (one loli-ish girl, one intensely well-endowed woman, one trustworthy-looking old guy, one slim main character with long brown hair and bangs, etc.), turned out to be super interesting, even the girl characters, though I found the three of them in general to be rotating between three states:<br /><ol><li>being coddled (as with Clover being sulky about Snake, or June being head-patted or cooed at)</li><li>being grumbled at/teased for being bitchy (as with Lotus, everywhere...<span class="shh">though I did really like how she turned out to be a programmer, wooo</span>)</li><li>being held hostage (all three of them)</li></ol>Also, at the end, everyone was pretty much disambiguated except for Lotus; the only thing that's explained about her background is that she's a mother, and other than her daughters being a part of the original experiment, her connection with the game nine years ago doesn't seem to be as strong.  Seven was the detective who saved all the children, Ace was the object of revenge, Junpei was there for the ~*time-bending craziness*~ -- but why Lotus?  Her children weren't even prominent characters in the game nine years ago; they're only mentioned, and their actions have no weight on the story at all.<br /><br />Plus, if Lotus is a mother who is a programmer and also well-read enough to know about prosopagnosia and the various morphic resonance experiments, why the hell is she dressed like a dancer?<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_SdPKamJbrgg/TRgvOsmT63I/AAAAAAAAABI/lvzJDGdQGrs/s1600/999-9-hours-9-persons-9-doors-20101216021437355.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="287" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_SdPKamJbrgg/TRgvOsmT63I/AAAAAAAAABI/lvzJDGdQGrs/s320/999-9-hours-9-persons-9-doors-20101216021437355.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="http://ds.ign.com/articles/114/1140602p2.html">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I mean, I'm not saying that being scantily clad, being a programmer, being well-read, being the bitch of the story, and being a mother are mutually exclusive -- just that they're all character traits that aren't supported or explained at all, which makes Lotus completely flat.  In one otherwise great and well-thought-out narrative you have one character, a female, who is essentially just there so you can break up your visual novel and intense puzzle-ing with boobs.  But -- but it's fine, right?  She hits the men characters and knows about proso-whatever, so it's not like she's just there to be seen as sexual, right?<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_SdPKamJbrgg/TRgx4c-zoDI/AAAAAAAAABQ/r3HJmZldBeE/s1600/lotus2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="192" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_SdPKamJbrgg/TRgx4c-zoDI/AAAAAAAAABQ/r3HJmZldBeE/s320/lotus2.jpg" width="256" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">DUNNO, BRO. (<a href="http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/showthread.php?t=60911">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />That was pretty much the only problem I had with a story that otherwise had me playing for nearly a week straight and throughout the night/morning by the time I reached the True Ending, though that was less a fault of compelling gameplay and more because I suddenly became terrified of everything and couldn't sleep until around 3am.<br /><br />Other notes:<br /><ul><li>The puzzles were really great, though if you click things enough times the characters will start to explain things/give them away.  I suppose this is good for the people who would just give up in exasperation if a game is too hard (the casual players everyone tries to cater to nowadays?) but it did mean that the game is considerably easier than Nancy Drew PC games, lululu</li><li>Super great localization...everything sounds really natural and there are even video game references, <em>waaaat</em></li><li>MINDBLOWING/INTERTWINING STORYLINES FTW &lt;3</li></ul></div>

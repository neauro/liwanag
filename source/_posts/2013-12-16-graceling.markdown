<blockquote><p>Katsa has been able to kill a man with her bare hands since she was eight - she's a Graceling, one of the rare people in her land born with an extreme skill. As niece of the king, she should be able to live a life of privilege, but Graced as she is with killing, she is forced to work as the king's thug.</p>

<p>When she first meets Prince Po, Graced with combat skills, Katsa has no hint of how her life is about to change.</p>

<p>She never expects to become Po's friend.</p>

<p>She never expects to learn a new truth about her own Grace - or about a terrible secret that lies hidden far away...</p></blockquote>

I finished <em>Graceling</em> and its companions in less than a week. I liked them — I liked the fairytale-ish turn of phrases ("she had one eye blue and one eye green"), the strangeness and OPness of Graces, the nondrama of sexual relationships. In <em>Graceling</em>, I can see how Katsa comes to like Po, and how her attraction to him is unique to her and her situation — being unable to trust that she wouldn't hurt anyone, he gives her a situation in which she can finally be herself.

The pacing was a little strange. One chapter near the beginning is devoted to exposition about the world, and is incredibly difficult to read through: there are so many new names to remember, so much information that gets in the way of the action I wanted to return to. The ending of the story drops suddenly as well: after Katsa primes the pirates to be ready for Leck's possible attack, it turns out Leck has already arrived at her supposed safehaven. Some of the motivations were tough for me to understand as well. How did Katsa and Po know so abruptly that Bitterblue was to be protected, at the cost of their own life? If Katsa was so adamant about not having children, why did she feel so strongly protective of Bitterblue? (I understand that you can not want to have children, and still like them; but there wasn't much other evidence for why Katsa would take to Bitterblue so strongly, especially given the distance with which she seemed to hold other acquaintances.) Why was Po ashamed of being blind? In fact, what was the purpose of those chapters at the end where the main Leck-related conflict has already been resolved, and all that's left is to angst about Po's blindness?

Overall <em>Graceling</em> was an entertaining read, and all the more fun because Katsa's "true" Grace was hinted at pretty well and it was fun to figure out for yourself what her talent actually was. I'm also a fan of how she worked out what sort of relationship that she wanted with Po in the end, though, like with Brave, I felt a little dissonance with what she perceived marriage to be. It's strange to read fantasy and sit tight for explanations of multiple kingdoms and magic powers — and yet never be told why there are such conservative constructions of marriage, and why they have remained unchallenged. The limitations that we have in Real Life — patriarchy, religious morals — aren't elaborated on in <em>Graceling</em> and some other fantasy novels. It's strange to read books where misogyny exists because that's "just the the way it is," even if characters challenge it later.

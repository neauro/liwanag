Man, that jumping mechanic was hard to get the hang of.<br /><br />From the beginning I had a definite <em>Ender's Game</em>-y feeling that my mission (something to the effect of "Go to an alien planet to disarm a bomb pointing at the earth!") was not what it seemed.  Sober, slow piano does not exciting background music to alien killing make.  The hint/instruction system, in the form of your commander in the top-left corner, also plays its part distributing uneasy feelings: though the earth is in imminent danger, the commander does not worry about its people but rather spends time giving you instruction, praising you when you launch yourself aggressively at alien ships (<em>"Nice shot!"</em>), and grumbling when you reach new sectors in the alien world (e.g. <em>"I'll never understand this place.</em>").<br /><br />Still, I move on.  Why?  Because it's a game, I guess.  It's a challenge.  There are glowing things in the environment, that's pretty nice.  Someone is telling me to press on.  It's not quite the same as <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> where I can see my goal (sleeping there peacefully in the big main shrine), but as per your usual game, all you can do within its realm is move forward.<br /><br />The game rewards you at the end with a poem or song which speaks about how <em>sacrifice will always be remembered</em>, and it reminds me of <a href="http://gawker.com/5847338/steve-jobs-was-not-god">this article</a>&nbsp;on Gawker, about Steve Jobs' death:<br /><br /><blockquote>Real outpourings of public grief should be reserved for those people who lived life so heroically and selflessly that they stand as shining examples of love for all of humanity. People like, for example, the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, who—along with his family—was bombed, beaten, and stabbed during his years of principled activism in the US civil rights movement. Shuttlesworth died yesterday, the same day as Steve Jobs. He did not die a billionaire.<br /><br />All deaths are sad for the living. Everyone deserves to be mourned, and well-known people will inevitably be mourned more loudly than others. But it is actually important to keep our grief in perspective. When we start mourning technocrats as idols, we cheapen the lives of those who have sacrificed more for their fellow man.</blockquote><br />For me, there's no constructive thought to be had in playing obituary olympics, but it does make me think more about what it means to "cheapen" someone's life.  Is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Shuttlesworth">Reverend Shuttlesworth</a> cheapened because no one laid iPad candles on his grave?  In contrast, is Jobs' life posthumously enriched by the Tweets of gadget-wielding strangers?<br /><br />If life can be viewed as a brief (normal, chemical) candle flame, I think that the best way to cheapen it, to waste someone's "sacrifice," would be to let that person's flame die out without ever touching yours.  It's hard to imagine what I, as a Filipino girl, can do to feel or express what I would feel comfortable calling "true reverence" for the death of a black man activist minister who lived so far away.  Shuttlesworth's (and Job's) work might not have been done; but we continue it in doing the best by others, and by our selves.  All we can do is move forward.</div>

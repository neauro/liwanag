The other day I tried applying to a job through the Amazon Careers website, and the experience was pretty interesting.<br /><br />The normal Amazon Careers website has a frame to the right which is the container for search results and job details.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tiEdJuD-92M/TlSShbRW-4I/AAAAAAAAAXU/VASbkoT6w2I/s1600/amazon2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tiEdJuD-92M/TlSShbRW-4I/AAAAAAAAAXU/VASbkoT6w2I/s640/amazon2.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">aww yeah. &nbsp;so much opportunity for employment</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Hjc2SGREjoo/TlSSmNRiiBI/AAAAAAAAAXc/r6P_kWXshuo/s1600/amazon3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="346" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Hjc2SGREjoo/TlSSmNRiiBI/AAAAAAAAAXc/r6P_kWXshuo/s640/amazon3.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">the first listing</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Unfortunately for me at the time, I was given a direct link to an internship which filled up the entire page.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FQD3hDyeSd0/TlSYFVqLdtI/AAAAAAAAAYE/v_ascKp2iqA/s1600/amazon22.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="358" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FQD3hDyeSd0/TlSYFVqLdtI/AAAAAAAAAYE/v_ascKp2iqA/s640/amazon22.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">does the font need to be that small?</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I think the link itself is deprecated because I couldn't find the job by searching through Amazon Careers, but I didn't know this at the time. And the last time I tried to apply for a job to Amazon before this was a couple months ago, so I already had a profile, albeit completely unrelated to the position that I was applying for now.  Still, I pressed "Apply Now," thinking that I could change that information before submitting.<br /><br />But the next page that showed up said, merely,<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FTpDjHR0C2c/TlSSxH52sVI/AAAAAAAAAXs/gJqwGgMfelY/s1600/amazon7%2B--%2Bstep%2B4.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FTpDjHR0C2c/TlSSxH52sVI/AAAAAAAAAXs/gJqwGgMfelY/s640/amazon7%2B--%2Bstep%2B4.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">wait...what about the first three steps?!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />"Step 4 of 4" could only mean "This is the last step before submitting your application," so I applaud the transparency of it. &nbsp;Still, for some reason I went and clicked through anyway, thinking that I'd still be able to change what irrelevant or old information that I had on file.  I didn't.  Ack!<br /><br />So I searched in haste for "My Account" to put in my application information. When I eventually found it It looks like this:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zp07gj5RBmI/TlSS07TDhJI/AAAAAAAAAX0/vzDs1gLiq5I/s1600/amazon5%2B--%2Byour%2Baccount.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zp07gj5RBmI/TlSS07TDhJI/AAAAAAAAAX0/vzDs1gLiq5I/s640/amazon5%2B--%2Byour%2Baccount.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">unexpectedly sparse</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The text is, to me, a little small for a page that has nothing else on it.  I guess it's easily remedied by just increasing the font size. &nbsp;(Also, is that a dangling list element?)<br /><br />The "Your Profile" page is similar.  This is where you fill in all the information that will be used to apply to whatever job at Amazon that you so desire.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6Wm2YVsUul4/TlSS67FYm4I/AAAAAAAAAX8/ETuOW4i4FfM/s1600/amazon6%2B--%2Byour%2Bprofile.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6Wm2YVsUul4/TlSS67FYm4I/AAAAAAAAAX8/ETuOW4i4FfM/s640/amazon6%2B--%2Byour%2Bprofile.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">this is everything Amazon needs to know about you.<br />name, address, and the last three degrees you earned (not pictured)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />So then I uploaded my profile, and...what? &nbsp;I'm still not quite sure whether the updated information is being used for the application that I had already submitted.  I imagine that it is, but even so, a confirmation would be nice.<br /><br />These are the things that I wish had been different about this process in general:<br /><ul><li><strong>I want to see what information you're submitting to a job</strong>.  Or, at least, a recap of what steps 1, 2, and 3 had been before I went through step 4.  Even now, months after first creating my account, I can't reconstruct what the previous steps would have been.  "Sign up, Fill in Information, Find Job and Apply?"</li><li><strong>I want the ability to apply to jobs that are completely different in nature.</strong>  In particular, I wish that I had been able to submit different resumes to different jobs, or that I could provide a cover letter for each one.  (I normally hate writing cover letters, but this position in particular was one that I enjoyed writing a cover letter for.  Ah, wasted effort!</li><li><strong>I want less fields about what school you went to on your Profile page</strong>.  How many applicants does Amazon have every day that have been to <em>three</em> post-high school schools?  Are there enough to justify making <em>everyone</em> go through filling this spaces in?</li><li><b>I want a notification about selection or non-selection of a position.</b>&nbsp; The whole process is pretty automatic-feeling anyway, so having a confirmation e-mail that an application was selected, or an e-mail gently letting down your hopes would be nice, haha.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><div>As a note, in order to get the "Step 4 of 4" screenshot I pretended I was applying to another arbitrary job, and the application still went through though I pressed "back" rather than the final "Submit." Out of curiosity, I just checked its status on the "Your Account" page.</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7DiZd3KoYPo/TlSV-PsCDwI/AAAAAAAAAYA/Mmc4a0s_LYQ/s1600/amazon8.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="358" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7DiZd3KoYPo/TlSV-PsCDwI/AAAAAAAAAYA/Mmc4a0s_LYQ/s640/amazon8.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">it reads, <i>Reviewed, Not Selected.</i><br />oh well, i guess</td></tr></tbody></table><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Which makes me think:</div><div><ul><li>Wow, someone reviewed my application fast!</li><li>Or else the computer just read through my resume quickly and tossed it out?</li><li>Wait, why are the other positions I applied to not showing up? &nbsp;Did my real application not actually go through? &nbsp;Or does this status thing just expire after a week or so?</li><li>Also, why does my application for the Design Intern position still say that my application is already on file, when this page obviously doesn't have it listed?</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>In conclusion: I have a weird feeling that people don't really get jobs through career websites, but through career fairs and internal connections, so I suspect the entire site is just a front anyway, haha.<br /><br /><b>Edit:</b>&nbsp;Oh! &nbsp;I did receive an automated "We received your application!" e-mail for the job I arbitrarily applied to just to obtain a screenshot. &nbsp;But it still reads "Reviewed, Not Selected" on the status page.<br /><br />¯\_(ツ)_/¯</div></div></div></div>

But Koschei has never before been seen through the eyes of Catherynne Valente, whose modernized and transformed take on the legend brings the action to modern times, spanning many of the great developments of Russian history in the twentieth century.<br /><br />Deathless, however, is no dry, historical tome: it lights up like fire as the young Marya Morevna transforms from a clever child of the revolution, to Koschei’s beautiful bride, to his eventual undoing. Along the way there are Stalinist house elves, magical quests, secrecy and bureaucracy, and games of lust and power. All told, Deathless is a collision of magical history and actual history, of revolution and mythology, of love and death, which will bring Russian myth back to life in a stunning new incarnation.</em></blockquote><br /><em>I can't even believe that I've never read anything by Catherynne Valente before.</em> Her writing is so gorgeous that I found myself struggling to slow down, to digest every word. True to the reviews on the inside cover, <em>Deathless</em> reads like modern fairytale, and for that reason even the stranger things in the book — Marya's scars like tiger stripes, her hair thick as snakes, her "twelve mothers" you never quite meet, the palaces she walks of twitching skin — sink and seep in easily, where in a less poetic book they might have instead made me wince. Similarly, things that might have bothered me in other books, I was fine with here. Years transpire believably in paragraphs. We leave Marya and return months later once she has already made friends we don't know, which she soon loses and spends the rest of the book crying for. Totally cool with it.<br /><br />I loved Valente's use of fairytale-esque repetition, the minimalist exposition and description that was just <em>barely</em> there. It was just the right amount of description to push you off the edge of things, and let the rest of you fly away into a sort of landscape that your own mind painted into her sketches.<br /><br />It occurs to me that this makes it sound as if you have to put a lot of effort into understanding things, but this isn't quite the case. Reading Valente's writing is like reading Tarot cards. You see the images — fill your mind with them — and all the intricacies come floating up on their own.<br /><br />Does that make sense either? To be honest, there's no description I have that can do justice; all I can say is that after reading this book I've become a seriose fan, and have already started for everything else she's written.</div>

Nowadays I get easily frustrated by movies.  The last straw was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picture_Perfect_(1997_film)">Picture Perfect</a>.  The main character, a woman, decides to focus on her career instead of on men, and succeeds in her work so drastically that her male boss is threatened by her, and passes her over for a promotion until she proves her "stability" to him be being in a relationship.<br /><br />Cool.  Thanks, romance movies.<br /><br />In any case, nowdays it's easier to stomach documentaries, particularly nature-related ones like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_Planet">The Blue Planet</a>.  Which is amazing!  I can't even imagine how they could have gotten some of this footage.<br /><br />The following are things that blew my mind the most.<br /><br /><br /><h3>There is life on earth that does not depend on the sun.</h3><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9Mt-1cxO72w/TmURm86YtoI/AAAAAAAAAbQ/pNVUZ_bmbr8/s1600/deepseavolcano.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="488" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9Mt-1cxO72w/TmURm86YtoI/AAAAAAAAAbQ/pNVUZ_bmbr8/s640/deepseavolcano.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">a colony beyond sunlight</td></tr></tbody></table><br />White crabs, fish, 2-meter long <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompeii_worm">Pompei worms</a>, and hundreds of other species live near underwater volcanic vents, completely independent from the sun.  Their survival instead depends on bacteria that can derive sulfides from the vent, and are to these creatures what plants are to us.  Volcanic vents like these are also often only active for a couple decades or so.<br /><br /><br /><h3>Shearwater birds can dive down to a depth of several meters.</h3><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uEs0yq0SkPM/TmUPzv9nenI/AAAAAAAAAbA/Khxv6vVLvJc/s1600/dolphinsandbirds.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="478" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uEs0yq0SkPM/TmUPzv9nenI/AAAAAAAAAbA/Khxv6vVLvJc/s640/dolphinsandbirds.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">dolphins and shearwaters underwater</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I mean, puffins can dive as well but I guess I was just shocked to see birds and dolphins swimming and eating <em>together</em>.  In this part of the documentary, a school of mackerel were cornered from above by the shearwaters and from below by the dolphins, and then later were set upon by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowfin_tuna">yellowfin tuna</a> (i.e. albacore).<br /><br /><br /><h3><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_squid">Firefly squid</a> have photophores not only on their tentacles, but over their entire body.</h3><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-F37c8zxsaOQ/TmUQ9RmhHQI/AAAAAAAAAbI/G4DNX-JI23k/s1600/fireflysquid.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="488" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-F37c8zxsaOQ/TmUQ9RmhHQI/AAAAAAAAAbI/G4DNX-JI23k/s640/fireflysquid.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">pretty!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />This was in the episode titled "The Deep" which in general was full of beautiful luminescent stuff, including <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vM1KhgloUA">Sea Gooseberries</a>, which I saw for the first time at the Monterey Bay Aquarium.<br /><br /><br /><h3><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capelin">Capelin</a> fish lay their eggs on beaches.</h3><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xc2iwaQqZtU/TmUTyjIiANI/AAAAAAAAAbY/kZ3Fgwns7eU/s1600/fishfish.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="482" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xc2iwaQqZtU/TmUTyjIiANI/AAAAAAAAAbY/kZ3Fgwns7eU/s640/fishfish.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">omg so many of them</td></tr></tbody></table><br />At the end of June/early July, capelin beach themselves to lay and fertilize their eggs.  This is possibly because the eggs are safer from predation here than in the open water.  Eggs laid here may also develop faster.<br /><br /><br /><h3>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Iguana">marine iguana</a> is the only lizard that can swim, and feeds on seaweed and algae.</h3><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VDCxpPe0NGU/TmUUVHIdvmI/AAAAAAAAAbg/904B0nrAqbU/s1600/iguana.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="482" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VDCxpPe0NGU/TmUUVHIdvmI/AAAAAAAAAbg/904B0nrAqbU/s640/iguana.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">ye. &nbsp;eat that algae</td></tr></tbody></table><br />In order to eat, it dashes down to rocks between strong breaker waves and eats the seaweed before dashing back up to safety again.  Or else it swims, though the documentary stated that only males can swim?  Weird.</div>

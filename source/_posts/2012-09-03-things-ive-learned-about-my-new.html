<br />Now that I'm moving into a place with a yard (!!), I've been eagerly making lists of easy and functional plants to attempt raising, such as rosemary, lavender, and mint. But then I saw blueberry plants at the farmer's market! And I remembered that a blueberry bush subsists in my childhood home, which means it's grown and borne fruit despite being under the care of a family with only a mildly green (like let's say <span style="color: #78ab46;">#78AB46</span>) thumb.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-afLO_FHRiSE/UEUCkMAIZ-I/AAAAAAAACXg/aG6dEvq1rhs/s1600/blueberry.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-afLO_FHRiSE/UEUCkMAIZ-I/AAAAAAAACXg/aG6dEvq1rhs/s640/blueberry.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">blueberryyyy</td></tr></tbody></table><br />This is what I've learned thus far about blueberry plant care from the farmer who sold me the plant, as well as a variety of internet sources:<br /><ol><li>Fertilizer meant for azaleas and rhododendrons is best for blueberries, presumably because it is acidic, and acidity is what blueberries like. Also good: peat moss.</li><li>No chicken manure! ("It's too sweet for them.")</li><li>Blueberries like their soil kept moist, and like at least 1" of water a week. Water is important for fruit growth.</li><li>They prefer 6-8 hours of sun.</li><li>Pruning is recommended in winter, for good air circulation and generally healthy plant growth.</li><li>When pruning, don't let branches crisscross; this helps the plant get good air circulation.</li><li>The particular breed I bought ("Jersey northern highbush") yields blueberries late in the year (as in, around now, instead of July through August.)</li><li>The particular variety I got is also self-pollinating, but also appreciates bees visiting from other blueberry plants.</li><li>Blueberries can propagate from cuttings! Not sure if I'll try this out immediately, though.</li></ol><div>Something else I've learned, unspecific to blueberries, is that I should really research plant care before purchase. The blueberry plant I bought has a lot of crisscrossing branches already, and some branches that droop so low they touch the ground...I'm sure I could have picked a better one if I knew what to look for.</div></div>

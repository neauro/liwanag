The last one, around St. Patrick's Day, was Green Mocha Cake, and the new one is Candied Carnations, for Mother's Day. (There's actually a whole slew of Mother's Day-themed offerings -- way to play it out to dat hardcore Zynga gamer mothers, haha.)<br /><br />Anyway, apparently when Francine bought one of my surplus Mocha Cakes, I got my Candied Carnation recipe leveled up instead.  Which begs the question -- which was she really buying?  Does the mastery gained from a special recipe that was discontinued just go to whatever the "present special recipe" is, if there is one? (I know before when people bought my Mocha Cakes, it leveled up the Mocha Cake, which was nice since, you know, it's not like I could level it up myself anymore.)  How does the English FarmVille fit into this equation, now that it has its own special recipe?<br /><br />All these answers and more, maybe this summer. :)</div>

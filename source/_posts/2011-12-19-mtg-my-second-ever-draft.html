Okay. Nice. I started grabbing Chapel Geists and also, at some point, a Cloistered Youth, Screeching Bats for the bomb factor, a Falkenwrath Noble. There's just something so classy about white/black.<br /><br />Second pack: Hinterland Harbor, Innistrad's rare blue/green land, something I'd like but which doesn't fit the colors I'm primarily using. Shoot. Luckily Andou was the person I was passing to, and I was sure that he would take it. &gt;)<br /><br />Third pack: <i>Skaab Ruinator. &nbsp;</i>Which pretty much required&nbsp;that I start using blue along with my other two colors.<br /><br />Figuring out how much mana is appropriate for a deck is what I think is the hardest about deck-building. &nbsp;It was a struggle especially in this one, since I had Screeching Bats, Geist-Honored Monks, and the Ruinator -- each of which require two black, two white, and two blue mana respectively, which makes selecting colors harder. &nbsp;Still, this deck did pretty well; at the very least there were few cases in which I didn't have mana at all, and when I had Skaab Ruinator I always managed to push him out successfully.<br /><br />The full list --<br /><br /><b>Creatures</b><br />1x Skaab Ruinator<br />1x Cloistered Youth<br />1x Silverchase Fox<br />1x Geist-Honored Monk<br />1x Unruly Mob<br />1x Slayer of the Wicked<br />2x Chapel Geist<br />1x Thraben Sentry<br />1x Village Bell-Ringer<br />1x Disciple of Griselbrand<br />2x Screeching Bat<br />1x Village Cannibals<br />1x Falkenrath Noble<br />1x Morkrut Bansee<br /><br /><b>Spells/Artifacts</b><br />1x Moment of Heroism<br />1x Rebuke<br />1x Bonds of Faith<br />1x Skeletal Grimace<br />1x Blazing Torch<br />1x Silver-Inlaid Dagger<br /><br /><b>Lands</b><br />8x Swamp<br />7x Plains<br />5x Island<br /><br />In the end, Matt won -- he had a deck with 3&nbsp;<a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=243211">Burning Vengeance</a>, which made ashes of everyone. <br /><br /></div>

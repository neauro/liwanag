But every choice has consequences, and as unrest surges in the factions all around her, Tris Prior must continue trying to save those she loves--and herself--while grappling with haunting questions of grief and forgiveness, identity and loyalty, politics and love.<br /><br />Tris's initiation day should have been marked by celebration and victory with her chosen faction; instead, the day ended with unspeakable horrors. War now looms as conflict between the factions and their ideologies grows. And in times of war, sides must be chosen, secrets will emerge, and choices will become even more irrevocable--and even more powerful. Transformed by her own decisions but also by haunting grief and guilt, radical new discoveries, and shifting relationships, Tris must fully embrace her Divergence, even if she does not know what she may lose by doing so.</blockquote><br />[spoilers ahead]<br /><br />Insurgent was okay. Like Divergent, it was full of action; unlike it, the action felt unfocused. Reading it was like going through an amusement park ride with great plastic things hissing from around very dark corner: thrilling, and not much else.  Insurgent tours readers around the enclosed communities of Tris’s world, but in a limited fashion: it’s still unclear why there are so many trains around for characters to use as transportation (who is even driving them? What are they carrying normally?), and until the end of the book I had completely forgotten that all the factions are enclosed in a fence.<br /><br />There were so many characters that I felt did nothing but burden the story. Though I could remember their names and a couple defining character traits (Lynn, "the bitter one;" Uriah, "the teasing hottie"), none of these characters really <i>did</i>&nbsp;anything to advance Tris’s understanding of herself or the world around her. For example, when Uriah is discovered to be Divergent, capable of somehow defying the simulation serums, the only consequence is a couple people snubbing him, slightly. Tris doesn’t seem to care one way or the other, so why should we? Even if the point is that Tris doesn’t care, why is it important at all that Uriah is Divergent?<br /><br />Some of these characters did contribute to powerful moments — I’m thinking in particular of when Marlene was entranced in a simulation that made her step off a rooftop — but even then Tris’s motivations seem unclear (Why did she save Hector? Why did Lynn thank her for it, and then say later that she loved Marlene? Huh?) and therefore overly dramatic.<br /><br />Ultimately I’ll still give the third book a try out of curiosity, because they’re so short and because pure "thrills" can still be delicious sometimes.</div>

Potato chips are my snack of choice. I saw this book and thought, <i>Wow, that is a great-looking bag, and honestly, it's got all the ingredients I really appreciate in a bag of chips.</i> I finished it in a single day, and then just felt like...<i>Well...that's it, I guess. </i>Time to look for something else to eat.<br /><br />(This, by the way, brings the number of dishes at my book-banquet up to at least three, the first items being <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/10/legend-marie-lu.html">cheesecake</a> and <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/12/blind-willow-sleeping-woman-haruki.html">green tea pudding</a>.)<br /><br />I thought the world was interesting, but I felt that its "grim" aspects were there to decorate the space of the story, rather than used to interact with it.&nbsp;<strike>Ravnica</strike>&nbsp;Ravka has supposedly rampant poverty, but no one really faces it.&nbsp;Ravka has been war-torn for hundreds of years, but there's no real evidence of it except for the strong militia, who are shown not fighting battles, but escorting people across "the Unsea," and fetching things for a dark dude called (surprise) the Darkling.<br /><br />It's kind of hard for me to bring up more critique about the characters in this story, mostly because I care so little about them. The Darkling and the main character Alina had some clever flirty dialogue, I guess. Mal seemed like a non-problematic male character, hurray. All the girls in the story seemed pretty flat. There's a super-talented bully, two friendly gossipers that Alina hangs out with but doesn't like, and a girl who can wield magical cosmetics who is jealously possessed by the Queen and alluded at some point to have been used for sex by the King. (On a side note, Bardugo seems to work as a makeup artist in Hollywood, so the presence of a makeup-y character is pretty cute.)<br /><br />The writing fell really flat for me, maybe because I'd just come away from <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/12/blind-willow-sleeping-woman-haruki.html">Haruki Murakami</a>. It was effective and easy and I raced through it, but it wasn't especially poignant. I felt like a good chunk of it was spent just describing the simple reds and blues and blacks of the coats people were wearing, or the elaborate carvings on the walls of the palaces Alina is in. (By the way, because Ravka is separated from its "True Sea" by "the Unsea," I was dying for Alina to see mother-of-pearl inlay on the palace walls and be like, <i>What the fuck, that stuff is awesome.</i>&nbsp;Unfortunately, no such drama occurred.)<br /><br />The Russian premise was interesting, but I was disappointed to learn through Goodreads reviews (like <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/283956289">this one</a>) that the Russian language was often misused and incorrect. Naming the magical miliary "Grisha" is the Russian equivalent of naming it "Bill" in English. <a href="http://ykmreviews.blogspot.com/2012/08/071-stormdancer-by-jay-kristoff.html">Appropriation in other young adult novels</a> bothers me, and this one is no exception.<br /><br />Well...that's it, I guess.</div>

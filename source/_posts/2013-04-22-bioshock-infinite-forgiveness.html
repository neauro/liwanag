I enjoyed it I guess. I play so few first-person shooters that I might as well go for the newest, most-polished one if I’m going to play anything while waiting (wistfully) for the next Metroid Prime. I have a penchant for headshots that seems to surprise people, but it is faster and cleaner and ultimately less squicky than melee in this game, which consists of scooping flesh from the faces of your opponents with a rotating hook-thingy. I saw the pink-red eye sockets of my first victim and felt ill and decided to go guns from then on, despite my usual powerful desire to greedily hoard any item I acquire in a game, including ammo.<br /><br /><br /><h2>2.</h2>The racism was also squicky. People seem to be very happy to engage in racism when it’s not real life, and defend its use as an edgy plot device. Ultimately I'm just exhausted by it, exhausted by black people apologizing to you over sudsy puddles, exhausted by Chinese people shouting for mercy in pidgin English before being disemboweled. I’m exhausted by the obsession of recreating racist worlds.<br /><br />In <i>Bioshock Infinite</i> you play as Booker Dewitt, and Booker doesn’t really care about racism one way or another. Oh, no, wait — I once ran into a black person who apologized for smoking in the back of a building, and Booker said something like, "Do what you want, I don’t care." That's Booker for you: except in combat, and except for the couple of times when he shouts after his sidekick, Elizabeth, Booker is cool as a cucumber. The setting of Columbia — the racism, the religion — slides off him like water off a duck's back.<br /><br /><br /><h2>3.</h2>Columbia (and its racism?) seems to be the system installed by its founder, a man named Comstock. Comstock later turns out to be you, which made something twist around in my stomach. <em>What?</em> How could Booker be Comstock? What in this story ever alluded to the idea that Booker could ever turn out to be Comstock? Booker is like a duck that’s been floating around in an indoor swimming pool, suddenly being told that with one little nudge he could have been the creator of that indoor swimming pool. Okay, not the best analogy, but look at him! He's a <em>duck</em>! How could he have gone from not caring about a black guy smoking in the back of a building, to someone who likens black people to dogs and says they should be thankful for the food and shelter given to them by their slavers?<br /><br /><br /><h2>4.</h2>There's really something to be said about how completely wonderful it feels when your brain finds patterns. I screamed with happiness when we ended up in Rapture again. I grabbed Andou's shoulder when Elizabeth looked over and said, "There's always a man, a city, and a lighthouse." My brain was like, <em>Hey, I know that! I thought that that beginning was all just homage, but it was on purpose! There's always a lighthouse!</em><br /><br />So that's what I wish I could pull in from an alternate dimension of game development: that Booker could have hesitated over racism — that he had had a chance to show that he could have been power-hungry, or obsessed with redemption, or obsessed with power enough to show how a the slightest nudge could have made him a Comstock monster. It would have been nice to see Booker reject his baptism and, when Elizabeth said there existed an alternate universe in which Booker accepted, to realize exactly what that meant. <br /><br /><br /><h2>5.</h2>Here was another fun part of the game's story: the first mention of quantum physics. Both Andou and I leaped and began to freak out. Oh my gosh, quantum physics. Quantum mechanics. Schrödinger's Cat. Is Columbia an epic experiment? Are we alive and dead?<br /><br />That paradox was so delicious that in some ways I wish that it had been everything, that somehow the setting could have abandoned its blaring, boring, meaningless racism and instead mused and ruminated on the significance or futility of our choices, and the consequences and not-consequences that bloom simultaneously after each. (Spare or kill? Bird or cage?)<br /><br />Booker already seems like a character set up perfectly for the agony of decision and regret: he kills Native Americans at Wounded Knee and seems to spiral downward from there, attempting (in one timeline) Christianity to clean away his presumed guilt. His room is cluttered with evidence of gambling, drinking. <em>Get the girl</em>, the game chants, <em>and wipe away the debt</em> — and imagine if Anna was some orphan he attempted to save, if she was a symbol of him trying desperately to do something good in his life, even if it meant the massacre of Columbia's peons.<br /><br /><br /><h2>6.</h2>Heck, the racism would have been way more interesting if it had been flavored with Booker's hypothetical thirst for forgiveness. Maybe the Booker that gets baptized can't deal with his being a murderer, and redefines people of color to be less than human to cope. Baptized Booker can't wait for his death to redeem him, so he takes heaven into his own hands, and decides who is saved and who is Sodom.<br /><br />As for the Booker that doesn't get baptized, maybe he encounters Anna on the way home, and uses her as his redemption instead. "I don't care how many people die," Booker could snarl at one point, "if it means that you are safe," if it means that his debts can be wiped away. Who are these Columbians anyway? Cult freaks — less than human.<br /><br />Ultimately both Bookers end up throwing away others for their own "Good." So how important was that baptism, in the end? How malleable is fate, after all is said and done?<br /><br /><br /><h2>7.</h2>There has to be room for Daisy Fitzeroy in this alternate dimension wish-fulfillment narrative as well, because I loved her before she was revealed to be an empty cliche of an Angry Black Woman. Maybe she could represent what it takes to forgive people who have transgressed against you, or what it takes to even decide whether or not people deserve to be forgiven.<br /><br />"Even you can be good again, Booker," Daisy might say if you made the right conversation choices. "Find forgiveness serving others." They can glance over at Elizabeth pointedly.<br /><br />"I'll have my debts forgiven, alright," Booker might mutter, still gruff.<br /><br /><br /><h2>8.</h2>All this forgiveness stuff could totally make Elizabeth's final standoff with her "mother" more impactful too. Maybe it could even tie in with Elizabeth's recurring issues with her supposed parents, her fury with them, how they "should" have been. How do Comstock and Booker try to protect her? How do their hopes and dreams live on through her, even when they die? Get it? Alive and dead at the same time? Eh? Ehhhh?<br /><br /><br /><h2>9.</h2>Yeah. A nugget of forgiveness would have been sick.</div>

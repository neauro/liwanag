A and I went to see *Frozen*, a movie I had very little interest in seeing until I realized Idina Menzel was voicing a main character. There's been a lot said already for the lack of diversity amongst the characters (regarding both <a href="">race</a>, as well as <a href="http://sapphicdalliances.tumblr.com/post/68881922280">the representation of women</a>) and my disappointment about these issues in *Frozen* has exhausted me utterly. I don't want to talk about it. Instead, I want to note aspects of the overall story that A and I discussed after the movie.

[ spoilers ahead ]

## *Frozen* is about Elsa and Anna
This is great. From the trailers, there was almost no indication that the story's main conflict involved the relationship between two women. Anna struggles somewhat with the men in the story, and though she desires "true love" at its beginning, lovers never usurp her existing relationship with her sister. At the end, Anna even plays the main role in saving both Elsa and herself, through the power of ~*True Love*~! Hurray!

## But what does *Frozen* do with "True Love"?
"True Love" seems to be Frozen's main theme. Elsa's version of True Love is "Don't harm those who you love," and requires her to isolate herself as a precaution to harming her sister; the fact that doing so makes both her and Anna unhappy are not as important as Anna's safety. At the end of the movie, Elsa realizes (somewhat abruptly) that her version of True Love is flawed, presumably because it's more about fearing herself, rather than loving someone else. (…right? This actually happened so suddenly that I'm just going to believe that this is the case.)

In contrast, Anna's version of true love — which could be described as "Always believe in someone that you love" — has absolutely no fear involved. Despite everyone's warnings and panic, Anna continues to believe the best of Elsa, even when Elsa actually *does* harm her.

I like how Elsa and Anna's interpretations of love clash in this movie, but one thing I don't like is that, though Elsa's view of love evolves by the end of the movie, Anna's view remains static. From the beginning Anna is the same "open to loving people!" character that she's shown to be from the beginning, despite events that show people can harm her: Elsa ostracizes her, Love Interest #1 (Hans) betrays her. That these events don't change her outlook on life feels like a waste; rather than actively choosing to love people, for Anna it's just a given, and this takes away from her complexity and agency as a character.

What's worse is that the events of the movie are put into motion by Elsa's fear that she might kill Anna, and by the end of the movie, it's revealed that there was no way that Elsa could have ever killed Anna at all. The entire time, Anna had a magical understanding of "True Love" that could have *always* saved her from Elsa's power, which makes the entire plot somewhat of a non-issue.

## And what did the other characters do?
Given that the movie's main conflict is Elsa and Anna's relationship, and true love, the other major characters — Kristoff, Olaf, and Hans — all felt thrown in. I would have loved to see them all focused to serve the "true love" theme by addressing love in different ways. Treated differently, Kristoff could have been a great catalyst for Anna's development of her version of love. I'm inagining him, a character distrusting of other humans, teaching her about the horrible things humans do; she fights it ("No way, humans are inherently Lawful Good!"); Kristoff then points out that her sister is laying waste to their kingdom and also has been pretty mean in general to people; Anna cracks a bit; and then, right on cue, Anna is betrayed again by Hans.

Kristoff's dislike of humans is played up without explanation of how it came to be, as if he had simply dropped out of the sky as a perfectly-formed gruff male love interest. I would have loved to see more time spent on him and his relationship with Sven and the snow trolls, rather than other seemingly extraneous details of his character. For example, why is it important that Kristoff is an ice merchant, and what was the point of the opening scene that is dedicated to showing his childlike failure at selling ice? You learn later that Kristoff was adopted by the trolls, and distrusts other humans; so if Kristoff was actually homeless at the beginning of the movie, why did he have a sled and ice-harvesting tools at his disposal? (Or was he not homeless? Are we just supposed to be okay with his abduction?) My headcanon involves Kristoff having saved Sven from the cruelties of humans in his life — meeting the trolls — realizing that they're way better.

Olaf was a character I grimaced at in the movie trailers and ended up being pleasantly entertained by.

Even though his main purpose is comedic entertainment, it would have been nice to see more about what he means to Anna and Elsa's relationship. He's their precious childhood snowman, and is really the only indication Anna has that Elsa still treasures her after years of being isolated.

As for the last major-ish character, Hans: I wasn't too interested in him, and wish that all the time devoted to him was given to the other characters instead. Hans is too flat, an antagonist that comes out of nowhere, affects no one uniquely, and isn't redeemed. Anna could have been betrayed by any other person; Kristoff could have found any other, more character-specific reason to back off from being with Anna.

## In conclusion
I had a lot of fun watching *Frozen*, particularly with the ~*twist*~ of Anna saving herself. And her kiss at the end with Kristoff was such consensual wow! Also, the particle effects were great.

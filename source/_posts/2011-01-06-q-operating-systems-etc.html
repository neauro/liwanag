<b>How do you switch drives with Windows command line?</b><br />If you want to go to drive <code>Z:</code>, rather than <code>cd Z:</code>, you can just type <code>Z:</code>.<br /><br /><br /><b>What do you do when you demux something?</b><br />A demultiplexer is a device that takes a single input signal and routes it to one of many output lines.  It's often used with a multiplexer on the sending end.  So, when you demux a signal, you accept it, and then based on some parameter send it to a different function or something. <span class="shh">I think?</span><br /><br /><br /><b>What's a virtual machine?</b><br />"A software implementation of a programmable machine" -- so, a simulation of a computer, on a computer.<br /><br /><br /><b>What's the difference between a function in C and a method in Java?</b><br />All C/C++ programs require a function named <code>main</code> and besides that can have numerous other functions.  In Java, functions can't stand by themselves -- they have to be part of a class.  Functions that are part of a class are usually called methods.<br /><br />Also, it seems that methods are called by reference values, which are objects, perhaps like <code>Object.method()</code>, as opposed to just <code>value = function()</code>?  Also, "method" is used more often in Java, most likely because Java has objects and C/C++ does not.<br /><br /><br /><b>What's Windows NT?</b><br />It's a family of operating systems created by Microsoft, which were meant to complement consumer versions of Windows that were based on MS-DOS.  NT was the first fully 32-bit version of Windows.  Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows 7, etc., are based on Windows NT, though they aren't branded the same way.  NT was once expanded to mean "New Technology" and stood originally for "N-Ten," the codename of the Intell i860 XR processor that the OS was originally developed for, but NT has no particular meaning anymore.  Sidenote: it is really confusing that there's an operating system called Windows <i>Server</i> 2003.  <i>Wat.</i>  I guess this calls into question what exactly a server is supposed to be.<br /><br /><br /><b>What is a server?</b><br />A server can refer to:<br /><ul><li>a computer program running as <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/01/intro-to-distributed-systems.html">a service</a>, to serve the needs or requests of other programs</li><li>a physical computer running one or more such services, to serve the needs of programs running on other computers in the same network</li><li>a software/hardware system such as a database server, file server, mail server, print server</li></ul>I guess server operating systems are operating systems that have certain features which make them good servers -- such as limited GUI, flexible/advanced networking capability, tight security, backup securities, transparent data transfer between different volumes or devices -- and maybe that's what the Windows Server operating systems are all about.<br /><br /><br /><b>How do you press Ctrl+Alt+Delete in a virtual machine?</b><br />In a virtual machine in MS Virtual PC 2007, rather than pressing the keys, go to the <code>Action</code> tab and select <code>Ctrl+Alt+Delete</code>.<br /><br /><br /><b>What does the <code>_</code> or <code>__</code> mean in C programs?</b><br />There's no particular meaning.  <code>_</code> is meant to identify system variables/functions, <code>__</code> is meant to identify metadata.  Additionally, when you include headers in C, you <br />add in a lot of code and functions and variables; to prevent these imported names from causing duplicates with the variables/names of your own stuff, it's best to avoid using variables/functions which start with underscores in your own program.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Source:<br />Jimmy<br />Wikipedia: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexer">1</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine">2</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT">3</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_%28computing%29">4</a><br /><a href="http://www.geekinterview.com/question_details/31163">GeekInterview: What is the difference between methods and functions?</a><br /><a href="http://www.dickbaldwin.com/java/Java008.htm">Dick Baldwin: Similarities and Differences between Java and C++</a><br /><a href="http://bytes.com/topic/c/answers/540408-_-__-significance">Bytes: _ and __ significance</a></div>

Escape from slaver&nbsp;Darwin West and his cruel Overseers. Escape from the backbreaking work of&nbsp;gathering Water. Escape from living as if it is still 1812, the year they were&nbsp;all enslaved.<br /><br />When Ruby meets Ford—an irresistible, kind, forbidden new Overseer—she longs to&nbsp;run away with him to the modern world where she could live a normal teenage&nbsp;life. Escape with Ford would be so simple.<br /><br />But if Ruby leaves, her community is condemned to certain death. She, alone,&nbsp;possesses the secret ingredient that makes the Water so special — her blood —&nbsp;and it’s the one thing that the Congregation cannot live without.<br /><br />Drought is the haunting story of one community’s thirst for life, and the&nbsp;dangerous struggle of the only girl who can grant it.</em></blockquote><br />Drought was okay. Ultimately I felt the really compelling ideas in the story --&nbsp;the life-giving blood, the 200-year-old-plus members of the capital-C Congregation -- were never&nbsp;given enough room to become really magical. Though she struggles with how to&nbsp;lead and sustain her community, the 200-year-old Ruby doesn't act or think like&nbsp;anything other than a suppressed teenager from any other YA novel. Does 200 years&nbsp;mean so little?<br /><br />Ruby's blood has the power to heal wounds and grant&nbsp;longevity&nbsp;to its drinkers,&nbsp;because she is the daughter of a man, Otto, who had the same. Ruby sneaks her blood into the Congregation's life-giving Water, which she and her Congregation gather under the chain whips of Darwin West. No one knows that the only active ingredient in Water is Ruby's blood. At some point in the past Otto left for some reason, and the Congregation&nbsp;and Ruby spend the entire novel praising and waiting for Otto to deliver&nbsp;them from their slavery. Spoilers: he does not. From whence did Otto come, to&nbsp;where did he go? Why does he have magical blood? Spoilers: you never learn.<br /><br />That you never learn who Otto is or why he and Ruby have magical blood feels unfair. The mystery and suspense of the entire book deflates anti-climatically with Ruby&nbsp;and Ford fleeing out to live their presumably superhuman-long lives&nbsp;together, since it's hinted that Ford, engorged with Ruby-blooded Water, might&nbsp;just match Ruby lifespan-wise. Even this might have been satisfying if Ruby had&nbsp;spared some thought to the effect of "I don't know who Otto is and I don't care,&nbsp;because I am done hinging my life on a person who hasn't existed in it since I&nbsp;was born 200 years ago."<br /><br />Ruby and Ford's romance was also a shrug for me, a love-at-first-sight that never grows into any deeper chemistry. They have a simple growing lust for one another, and Ford makes promises to Ruby that he'll give her everything she wants, which at first iteration involves popcorn and warm spaghetti. Ford plays a blue-eyed teenager who pulls on an Overseer's tormentor mask so as to earn health insurance for his mother, who is apparently dying of cancer. Can Ruby's magical blood cure Ford's mother? Spoilers: this isn't something discussed in the novel, though I really wish it was. Imagine if the conflict in this book involved Ruby considering giving Ford her blood, torn between wanting to keep her healing blood a secret and wanting to help Ford, torn between wanting him happy and wanting him to stay even if his mother were well...something like this might have more tightly bound the themes of "healing blood" and "young/first love," maybe, shrug.<br /><br />One thing that I really loved about this book were its antagonists, which at first numbered Darwin, head exploiter of the Congregation, whose whip comes out at the least provocation and results in the frequent bloody beating of Ruby's mother. Darwin comes up with a variety of ways to torture the Congregation, each more frustrating to read about than the last. Ruby's mother is the other antagonist, at first a supportive figure whose unending mantra to "<em>sustain</em>" the Congregation, rather than break free, becomes absolutely infuriating after a while (in a good, "This character is making me have feelings! Whoa, look at the conflict!" way).</div>

A couple nights ago I attended the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/gamesjs/events/27773901/#initialized">GamesJS Kickoff Meeting</a>, at which were speakers discussing the advantages of game development in HTML5 and JavaScript.  It was held at IGN.  The place turned out to be filled with a lot of indie game devs, and a lot of the advantages toted were that of the cross-platformability of games built using HTML5 and JavaScript, which can go on phones and computers without any worries of Flash compatibility.  Plus, for any indie game dev, to choose only one platform for your baby heavily limits its potential audience.<br /><br />I have to admit now that the only thing I know about HTML5 is that it has a &lt;canvas&gt; tag.  I know JavaScript, but not to its very fibers.  I was mainly going as a deep-dive, and man, there were so many technologies that I have never heard before, and am bookmarking here for later investigation:<br /><br /><strong>crafty.js</strong><br /><a href="http://craftyjs.com/">crafty.js</a> is the Flixel of JavaScript.  Collision detection!  Sprite maps!  Woo!<br /><br /><strong>jsFiddle</strong><br />The presentation for crafty.js had a lot of this <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a> stuff, which I guess is like a JavaScript console, which is super cool.  I talked to Kelly about it excitedly and he was like, "Yeah.  It's pretty neat.  <span class="shh">I guess.</span>" lol kelly whatever<br /><br /><strong>Spaceport</strong><br /><a href="http://sibblingz.com/">Spaceport</a> is another game engine which aids cross-platform support from web to iOS.  Write your JavaScript and translate it to ActionScript like instantly!  It has super good performance and will be in public beta sometime in September.  You can purchase a license or, if you are a poor game dev, you can use Spaceport through a revshare model.<br /><br /><strong>V8</strong><br />During the Spaceport presentation, talk about something called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/v8/">V8</a> suddenly happened.  It turns out that <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/v8/intro.html">V8</a> is Google's "open source, high performance JavaScript engineâ€¦written in C++ and used in Google Chrome."<br /><br /><strong>Google Web Toolkit (GWT)</strong><br />The last speaker was a woman from Google who spoke briefly about <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">GWT</a>, which is a "Java software development framework" which allows you to build user interfaces, have client-server communication, etc.  You can deploy applications you make to the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>.<br /><br /><strong>PlayN</strong><br />I couldn't actually find a link for this yet, but PlayN is relevant to games on Google+.<br /><br /><br />There is just SO MUCH technology in the world.  People didn't really talk to each other during the meetup (then again, I came late and perhaps wasn't trying hard enough to ~*network*~ with everyone), but still, being in a place like this really makes me feel inspired to learn more about everything.<br /><br />Afterward, Kelly, Jonah and I walked through downtown talking about all the places we've been and the bros we had and went to Bi-Rite Creamery.  I tried the Dainty Gentleman, which is a concoction of: 2 scoops of honey lavender ice cream, with drizzles of hot fudge and blood orange olive oil, sprinkled with seasalt.  You would not believe the amazing flavors that comes out of this combination.</div>

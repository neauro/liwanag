Werewolf deck is getting more complete than it was <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/10/silly-werewolf-decklist.html">before</a>, thanks to trades and gifts from Chris and Edison-san!<br /><br />Here's the newer version:<br /><br /><br /><strong>Creatures</strong><br />4x Reckless Waif<br />4x Kruin Outlaw<br />3x Instigator Gang<br />2x Daybreak Ranger<br />4x Mayor of Avabruck<br />2x Gatstaf Shepherd<br /><br /><strong>Spells/Artifacts</strong><br />2x Ranger's Guile<br />4x Full Moon's Rise<br />4x Moonmist<br />3x Incinerate<br />3x Shock<br /><br /><strong>Lands</strong><br />4x Rootbound Crag<br />2x Kessig Wolf Run<br />1x Copperline Gorge<br />10x Mountain<br />8x Forest<br /><br /><br />Also, reasons why:<br /><ul><li>No more red two drops in the form of Village Ironsmith, but given the choice of having Village Ironsmith or Kruin Outlaw, I'd always want Kruin, even if it took another turn to get out.</li><li>I initially had some Prey Upons as kill cards, but the problem with them is that they are Sorceries, which means I need to play them on my turn if I ever want to use them -- my precious turn, which I could have instead used to play nothing, in order to transform wolves.  Awoooo~</li><li>Incinerates/Shocks are Instants and can be played on the opponent's turn, which means I can skip my own turn to go wolves, then still kill things.  Hurray!  (To be honest, I'm not sure why I didn't have many of these earlier.)</li><li>Less Instigator Gang: because Andou explained to me that when you get 4 of something, that means that you usually want a high chance of getting that card on your opening hand, and Instigator Gang (with a cost of 4 mana) is really more of a later-game thing.</li><li>Max Mayor of Avabruck: because he's a two drop which can buff either humans or werewolves, and also potentially generate 3/3 Wolf tokens in the end step, which can block hits on the opponent's next turn if I happen to go all in with werewolves at the end of my turn.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FrivM_1Q3zk/TrijFXjAuKI/AAAAAAAAAhM/TZTkhlZJeQU/s1600/827_mayorofavabruck_alt.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="251" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FrivM_1Q3zk/TrijFXjAuKI/AAAAAAAAAhM/TZTkhlZJeQU/s320/827_mayorofavabruck_alt.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">and how can you say no to this mustache?<br />(<a href="http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol13/issue1/donath.html">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table></li><li>No more Manabarbs: because I really wanted them to be successful, but I was never able to pull them off.  I guess the problem is that with werewolves you really have to watch your spell usage in general, and if it's my turn I'd rather be playing Full Moon's Rise, or another werewolf.</li><li>No more Caravan vigil or Traveler's Amulet or Shimmering Grotto: because those were really just there as substitutes for Rootbound Crags or Copperline Gorges, which I now have 4 and 1 of, respectively.  Both can tap for red or green, but Rootbound Crag will come into play tapped if you do not already control a Forest or Mountain, and Copperline Gorge will come into play tapped if you already have more than two lands in general.  It is a little weird to have just one Copperline Gorge; on one hand I'd benefit by having a lot of them because then I'd be sure to get them in an opening hand (meaning they would be able to come into play untapped), on the other hand I'd have a lot of them, and even if I got them in my first hand, that would mean that one of them would definitely come into play tapped.</li></ul><br />Thus far werewolf deck is faring pretty well against Andou's white token deck and is kinda-sorta even with his white/green humans.  I'm not sure how to improve upon it anymore, except to keep balancing mana; I recently took out a Shock and an Incinerate and replaced them with more land, but then felt like I was getting gluts of useless land every turn when really a burning spell would have been nice.  So it goes.</div>

<blockquote>Jirou dreams of flying and designing beautiful airplanes, inspired by the famous Italian aeronautical designer Caproni. Nearsighted from a young age and thus unable to become a pilot, Jirou joins the aircraft division of a major Japanese engineering company in 1927. His genius is soon recognized, and he grows to become one of the world's most accomplished airplane designers.</br><br/>
Key historical events deeply affected the course of Jirou's life, including the great Kanto earthquake of 1923, the Great Depression, the tuberculosis epidemic, and Japan's plunge into war. He meets and falls in love with Naoko, grows and cherishes his friendship with his colleague Honjou, and innovates tremendously, leading the aviation world into the future.

I saw The Wind Rises last weekend, dubbed. It was one of the few times in recent memory that I actually paid for popcorn and even a coke slushie at a theater. *The latter itself was $6.50. Jeez.*

[ mild spoilers ahead ]

Reasons why you should see it:
<ul>
<li>The animation is gorgeous.</li>
<li><em>Really gorgeous.</em></li>
<li>The dreamy, vague nature of time and places keeps you on your toes. I found it fun to put the fluid pieces of the movie together.</li>
<li>I loved watching the way different characters interacted with each other. For example, Jiro and Honjo never say to each other, "You are my best friend," but they take pains to eat together, help each other, and get assigned to the same projects. Honjo never says "I need to take care of your air-headed sorry ass all the time;" but he rolls his eyes at Jiro only ever eating spongecake, and when Jiro is assigned separately from him to travel the world, he says, "<em>Alone</em>?" with a certain anxiety that I appreciate for its show-don't-tell-ness.</li>
</ul>

[ less mild spoilers ahead ]

Unfortunately:
<ul>
<li>Some of the dubbed lines have jarringly awkward wording.</li>
<li>The movie walks through significant Japanese historical events and ideals, which can be totally lost on you if you have no idea what they are.</li>
<li>None of the characters develop. All of them begin with certain motivations at the beginning of the story, and end having those same motivations. There's no real struggle; even moments I thought were somewhat stressful (Jiro's planes constantly failing and falling in a blaze; Jiro being hunted by the secret police) were never played up, and therefore never felt meaningful. So why have them?</li>
<li>There's not too much of a unifying theme, which is ultimately fine, though nowadays "unifying themes" and their skews and slants are what get me really hyperventilating about certain media.</li>
</ul>

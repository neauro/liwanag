Our CEO and one of the designers attended the conference and were subsequently impressed by the fact that many of the finalists, like Sissyâ€™s Magical Ponycorn Adventure, had been created in one or two days during the <a href="http://arisgames.org/global-game-jam-2011/">2011 Global Game Jam</a>.<br /><br />So, now we're having a company-wide game jam!<br /><br />I don't yet have a "dedicated" programmer on my team, so I'm programming for myself.  I haven't touched Flixel in 4 months but maybe if I hit myself against it hard enough, for for long enough, everything will be just fine.<br /><br />Our theme was "restraint" (a theme from a previous GGJ).  Our game's present working title is just "Spider," and I need to get back to it!<br /><br /><strong>Update:</strong> "Finished" game post is <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/10/game-itsy-bitsy-spider-of-cosmos.html">here</a>.</div>

<span class="sig">What is a remote procedure call (RPC)?</span><br />RPC is a paradigm for providing communication across a network between programs written in a high-level language.  "Procedure calls" in general are a well-known and well-understood way of transferring control and data within a program on a single computer -- a program calls a procedure, giving it certain arguments, and receives some output from the procedure back.  So, a remote procedure call -- when a program calls a procedure that is not necessarily on the same system that the program is on -- should be workable as well.<br /><br />An RPC "cycle" goes like this:<br /><ol><li>A remote procedure is invoked by a caller, who passes the procedure parameters</li><li>The caller's environment is suspended as it waits for a response</li><li>The parameters are passed across the network to the environment where the procedure will execute</li><li>The desired procedure is executed</li><li>When the procedure finishes executing, the results are passed back to the calling environment</li><li>The caller's environment resumes with the new data (or else fails, I assume, because of a timeout...though the "Implemented remote procedure calls" didn't use timeouts, since single-machine systems don't)</li></ol><br /><br /><span class="sig">What are the advantages of RPC?</span><br /><ol><li><strong>Clean and simple semantics.</strong>  <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/01/intro-to-distributed-systems.html">Distributed systems</a> are complicated because communication throughout one is complicated, so simplicity is good.</li><li><strong>Simplicity.</strong>  Which means it's probably fast.</li><li><strong>Generality.</strong>  Procedure calls work in single-machine systems, besides being usable in distributed systems.</li></ol><br /><br /><span class="sig">What are the disadvantages of RPC?</span><br />There are some design issues --<br /><ul><li>What semantics do you use when the machine fails, or when communication fails?</li><li>What are the semantics when a caller does something address-specific, and the caller and callee don't have a shared address space?</li><li>How do you integrate RPC into existing/future programming systems?</li><li>How does a caller figure out the location and identity of the procedure it wants?</li><li>What's a suitable protocol for the transfer of data?</li><li>How do you provide data integrity and security in an open communication network?</li></ul><br /><br /><span class="sig">Really general implementation</span><br />The structure of RPC is based on the concept of <em>stubs</em>; the parts of the program involved in an RPC (the user, the user-stub, the RPC communications package, the server-stub, and the server) are all executed on their respective places, and when a user wants to use an RPC, it really just calls its user-stub, which is what makes the RPC.  This way, specifying the target procedure and the arguments is sent in a "call packet" to the server-side stuff, which is handled similarly: the server-stub unpacks the packet, makes a local call to the procedure on the server, and packs it up again in a "result packet" to be sent to the caller.  This serves to encapsulate everything (I think?).<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SdPKamJbrgg/TSPV2_29a7I/AAAAAAAAADs/WoPFIW0-3zM/s1600/rpc%2Bstubs.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="161" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SdPKamJbrgg/TSPV2_29a7I/AAAAAAAAADs/WoPFIW0-3zM/s320/rpc%2Bstubs.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">from "Implementing Remote Procedure Calls"</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The RPCRuntime handles the actual handling-off between the user-stub and the server-stub.<br /><br />The semantics of RPCs can also be handled without needing a specialized packet-level protocol.  <br /><br /><br /><span class="sig">Other notes:</span><br /><ul><li>RPC is supposed to make distributed computation more easy; in the "Implementing Remote Procedure Calls" paper, the authors hoped to solve the difficulty of distributed systems communication and leave only the problems of timing, independent failure of components, and the coexistence of independent execution environments.</li></ul><br /><br />Source:<br /><a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=357392">Andrew Birrell and Bruce Nelson.

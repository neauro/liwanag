He also wrote about his endeavors <a href="http://evolutionlive.blogspot.com/2012/02/love-letter-released.html">here</a>.<br /><br />Other interesting fact I learned from Alex: the art is inspired partly a poster from <a href="http://ifartrainbow.com/">Enfu</a>&nbsp;-- you can tell by the outlines, which are dark blue rather than black!</div>

He has no memories, no identity, and no pulse, but he has dreams. His ability to connect with the outside world is limited to a few grunted syllables, but his inner life is deep, full of wonder and longing.<br /><br />After experiencing a teenage boy's memories while consuming his brain, R makes an unexpected choice that begins a tense, awkward, and strangely sweet relationship with the victim's human girlfriend. Julie is a blast of color in the otherwise dreary and gray landscape that surrounds R. His choice to protect her will transform not only R, but his fellow Dead, and perhaps their whole lifeless world.<br /><br />Scary, funny, and surprisingly poignant, Warm Bodies explores what happens when the cold heart of a zombie is tempted by the warmth of human love.</i></blockquote><br />I read <em>Warm Bodies</em>&nbsp;a couple weekends ago and it was positively delightful. Every other page I was waving my arms in A's direction and begging him to listen to me read aloud. "Zombie romance" does seem to be the next logical step after "vampire romance" and "werewolf romance," but I never thought it would be this fun.<br /><br />[spoilers ahead] <br /><br />The only thing that fell flat for me was the character of Julie, who wavered a little too far on the side of the Dreaded Manic Pixie Dream Girl for me, and her quirks — keeping a wall in her room for "the future," adopting a nickname of "Julie Cabernet" instead of "Julie Grigio" — were not just "meh," but also didn't contribute noticeably to the plot. The fact that she came to be considered as So Important to the healing of zombies by the book's end also wavered uncomfortably on Mary Sue-ness.<br /><br />Other than that, <em>Warm Bodies</em> was tons of fun. Marion's detail on the "culture" of zombies — the way years pass in a haze, the way some zombies become skeletal "Boneys," the way hunger resonates through their cells and how they are sated only with living brains and flashes of memory — were fantastic. So too were the little details of his world's apocalypse: the way some people miss the sound of airplanes, for example, or the way that stadiums have been disemboweled and remade into gigantic slums. Marion's writing is also super poignant in illustrating the typical un-life of a zombie.<br /><br /><blockquote><em>There is a chasm between me and the world outside of me. A gap so wide my feelings can't cross it. By the time my screams reach the other side, they have dwindled into groans.</em></blockquote><br />I was surprised to learn there are even more <em>Warm Bodies</em> books, and though I felt this first volume ended on a pretty satisfying note, I'm sure I'll get to the others eventually.</div>

<span class="sig">What's a semaphore?</span><br />A semaphore is a procted variable or abstract data type.  It relates to controlling access to some resource shared by processes running simultaneously.  They're useful in preventing race conditions and deadlocks (though they don't prevent them completely).<br /><br />Semaphores don't keep track of which resources are free or who is using the resources; they only keep track of whether resources are free.  There are two types of semaphores: <b>counting semaphores</b> and <b>binary semaphores</b>.  Counting semaphores only keep track of how much of the resource is available at a given time (i.e. "all of my resources are being used up now...oh, someone came back, okay, now I have one free which you can use").  Binary semaphores only keep track of whether a resource is being used or not, i.e. whether it is presently unavailable or available.<br /><br />Semaphores can't prevent errors that occur if a process that has acquired a lock for the resource forgets to release the lock, etc.<br /><br />Also, errors can still happen if there are different resources managed by different semaphores and processes need to use more than one resource at a time.  An interesting thing: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem">dining philosophers problem</a>, which illustrates the problems with multiple processes sharing multiple resources.  Essentially, five philosophers are sitting at a table, either eating or thinking.  They each have a fork to their left and right, and there is a bowl of spaghetti in the middle of the table.  The philosophers need to serve themselves and eat spaghetti with both forks, but don't speak to each other, so one may pick up a left fork and wait for his right fork to become free so that he may eat.  Meanwhile, the guy using his right fork may be waiting for his own other fork to become free.  And so on, and so forth.<br /><br />A semaphore in this case would be like a person who is aware of which forks are being used and which ones are available, so that when the philosophers try to eat, they have to consult him first, and he'll tell them whether there are any forks to pick up which they can use.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_SdPKamJbrgg/TS9WBJzlB7I/AAAAAAAAAEk/QEHATD_NLWw/s1600/proceed%2Bcat.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="283" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_SdPKamJbrgg/TS9WBJzlB7I/AAAAAAAAAEk/QEHATD_NLWw/s320/proceed%2Bcat.jpg" width="300" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">semaphore cat is semaphore</td></tr></tbody></table><br />One problem with semaphores: <strong>busy waiting</strong>, which is what you need to put into processes that are waiting for other processes to finish executing their critical section.  (Or, what philosophers are doing when they are waiting for their neighbors to finish eating.) The busy waiting is basically just a loop waiting for the mutex to free up, and it wastes CPU that another process could be productive with.  A process that does this is a <strong>spinlock</strong>, because "the process 'spins' while waiting for the lock."  Essentially, if a program knows it needs a lock before it does the next bit of code, it sits in a while loop until the needed lock is freed up.<br /><br /><br /><span class="sig">What's a mutex?</span><br />A mutex is essentially a binary semaphore, though mutex specifically describes an abstraction which prevents two processes from executing the same piece of code or accessing the same data at the same time.  Basically, it limits access to a single resource, to one "owner" who is at that time allowed to do whatever it wants with it before releasing the mutex so someone else can do something.<br /><br /><br /><span class="sig">What does IRQL mean?</span><br />IRQL stands for Interrupt Request Level, and has something to do with a process, and, given incoming interrupts, which one of those interrupts should be able to interrupt the running process, and which should not.  For instance, if you're just quickly trying to modify a single variable, then you don't want anything to interrupt you.<br /><br />Basically (I think), each thread has its own IRQL.  If the OS receives another thread to run which has a higher IRQL than that first thread, however, then it will pause the lower-IRQL thread to run the higher-IRQL code.  Weird deadlocks may occur in this case, however, if:<br /><ol><li>lower-IRQL thread is running, and acquires a lock</li><li>lower-IRQL thread is interrupted; higher-IRQL thread begins execution</li><li>higher-IRQL thread needs the lock that lower-IRQL thread has</li><li>higher-IRQL lock cannot continue without that lock</li><li>lower-IRQL thread cannot continue without higher-IRQL finishing execution</li></ol>So, what you would want to do in this case is make sure that a thread that obtains a lock cannot be interrupted.<br /><br />If it does so happen that you don't want any interrupts to your thread, then make sure that the IRQL is raised to <code>APC_LEVEL</code>.  This level is pretty much only run when you're using Fast Mutexes.  Part of the reason why Fast Mutexes are faster than normal Mutexes in the Windows kernel is because they deny APC interrupts.  APC interrupts originate from the processor, toward itself or another processor.<br /><br /><br /><span class="sig">How do I use a mutex in the Windows NT kernel?</span><br /><a href="http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~heha/oney_wdm/ch04f.htm">Here's</a> a start...<br /><br /><br />Sources:<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_%28programming%29">Wikipedia: Semaphore (programming)</a><br /><a href="http://us.generation-nt.com/answer/fast-mutexes-guarded-mutexes-help-27627542.html">GNT: Fast mutexes and guarded mutexes?</a><br /><a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/askperf/archive/2009/07/21/the-basics-of-mutexes-and-spin-locks.aspx">TechNet: The Basics of Mutexes and Spin Locks</a><br /><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/doronh/archive/2010/02/02/what-is-irql.aspx">MSDN: What is IRQL?</a><br /><a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CBMQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fdownload.microsoft.com%2Fdownload%2Fe%2Fb%2Fa%2Feba1050f-a31d-436b-9281-92cdfeae4b45%2FLocks.doc&amp;rct=j&amp;q=ex%20initialize%20fast%20mutex%20example&amp;ei=yJEzTf7ILIGqsAP4rqiFBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNEWYt0oNPRzKd8sXHFsm_CgrHKZBw&amp;sig2=4FQ-QHdGlj_42VPdrKqIxA&amp;cad=rja">Windows Hardware and Driver Central: Locks, Deadlocks, and Synchronization</a><br /><em>Operating System Concepts (8th Edition)</em>, Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne, ISBN 978-0-470-12872-5.</div>

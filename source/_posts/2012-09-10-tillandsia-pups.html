<div class='post'>
So at the end of last May, I acquired a pair of air plants from a street fair, both of them mid-bloom. The one on the left is, I think, some kind of <i>Tillandsia&nbsp;stricta</i> (maybe the "<i>stricta rio</i>"?). I'm pretty sure the one on the right is <i>Tillandsia ionantha.</i><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zBiiauAqi3A/UE5Ia1nN2wI/AAAAAAAACdU/1yIk4UawYfQ/s1600/tillandsia1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zBiiauAqi3A/UE5Ia1nN2wI/AAAAAAAACdU/1yIk4UawYfQ/s640/tillandsia1.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i left the flowers on even after they died because i thought it they still looked a little festive...</td></tr></tbody></table><br />After I bought them I started looking up how to take care of them, and was a disappointed that many websites say that air plants are monocarpic, meaning they flower once and die. (That's what I get from picking the prettiest plants from the bargain bin, I guess.)<br /><br />Other things learned about air plants at the time:<br /><br /><ul><li>they need watering about once a week</li><li>though you can mist them to water them, it's better to just dunk them underneath a sink to soak them them all the way through</li><li>air plant roots are primarily used for holding onto things, not for absorbing water</li><li>make sure to shake plants so they don't have water pooling in crevices or near roots</li><li>hard water, which has a lot of minerals, can clog up the filaments in tillandsia leaves that draw in the plant's nutrients; luckily, Pacific Northwest tap water is some of the softest water in the US ;D</li><li>filtered light (which is sunlight that goes through some sort of filter, like a window), is best</li><li>after air plants flower, they may reproduce, creating a new offset which is called a "pup"</li></ul><div><br />So I guess the plants might "pup"? I started a (somewhat inconsistent) regimen of dunk-watering about once a week. Four months later, I<i>&nbsp;</i>abruptly realized that my air plants <i>are</i>&nbsp;having pups!</div><div><br /></div><div>...I think? In any case, the <i>stricta</i> appears to have a little dent in its clutch of spiny leaves where something looks to be emerging:</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9e7VYtF_2uo/UE5Qp_Y7SmI/AAAAAAAACeU/HTakw2cvUn0/s1600/tillandsia2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9e7VYtF_2uo/UE5Qp_Y7SmI/AAAAAAAACeU/HTakw2cvUn0/s640/tillandsia2.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">it's a little blurry...</td></tr></tbody></table><br />After searching for a similar dent in the <i>ionata</i>, I realized that it the whole thing was in fact quickly becoming two plants:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-47Vq3KXPhwU/UE5RPuJm6DI/AAAAAAAACec/z605d1A5X6U/s1600/tillandsia3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-47Vq3KXPhwU/UE5RPuJm6DI/AAAAAAAACec/z605d1A5X6U/s640/tillandsia3.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">near my thumb there!</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />Hurray :)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.justairplants.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=63&amp;Itemid=68">It seems</a> that you can separate pups from the mother plant after they are about 1/2 or a 1/3 the size of the parent, but I'm not sure if I will yet. It also seems that plants show "an&nbsp;exaggeration&nbsp;of the natural curvation of their leaves" if they don't have enough water so...oops. @__@ I thought these curves were pretty attractive but I guess I should soak these plants overnight. Which seems like it would kill them, but I haven't found a source yet that says air plants are capable of being overwatered.<br /><br />Finding a book about air plants would be better than the soup of websites I've been finding, but I haven't yet discovered one. Another book I'd like to find: one that discusses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marimo">marimo</a>, my newest "easy to care for living thing" interest.</div>

From <em>Re-Space-ing Place: "Place" and "Space" Ten Years On</em>:<br /><blockquote>My goal [in this paper] is to understand two related developments over the last decade. <strong>One is the way in which the conceptual distinction between place and space has been taken up by [computer-supported cooperative work] researchers</strong>, and to see what kinds of light we might be able to cast on this by returning to the roots of this distinction in fields such as geography and urban studies that have something to say about the social organization of spaces. The other is the ways in which our heightened understanding of the issues of mobility and information as an aspect of everyday life, emerging out of studies and experiences with mobile technologies, might reinvigorate a conceptual exploration of questions of practice and spatiality, and help us deepen our understandings of the implications of arguments about place and space.<br /></blockquote><br />I'm always surprised by HCI's pure ability to study People Doing Things, whether its people out living their lives in the world, or <em>other people studying HCI.</em></div>

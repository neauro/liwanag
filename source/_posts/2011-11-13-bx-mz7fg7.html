Two weeks ago I attended my first Magic: The Gathering draft tournament at The Dreaming.<br /><br />This is how you draft:<br /><ol><li>Pay some money.  This money pays for 3 booster packs.</li><li>Sit around a table with some other people, all of which also have 3 booster packs.</li><li>Open a pack.</li><li>Select a card from the pack.</li><li>Give the person on your right or left the rest of the cards from this pack.  You too will receive a set of cards from someone on your right or left.</li><li>Select another card.</li><li>Repeat until all cards are gone; then open another booster pack, and repeat until all cards are gone; etc.</li><li>Once you have made your selections, create a deck, using an "infinite" stock of mana from the host.</li><li>After that, battle!</li></ol><br />The first rare card that I got was an Angel of Flight Alabaster, so I started grabbing all the spirits and white creatures in general I could find, then eventually split into grabbing red creatures as well, mostly vampires and also a holographic Village Ironsmith that I couldn't resist.  (Werewolves &lt;3)<br /><br />I ended up only winning one match that night (against Kelly and his preponderance of Unruly Mobs) but still got away with an extra booster pack as a prize, which is not bad.  It was pretty fun to play with new people in general, though I tend to be pretty shy and besides that forget a lot of rules.  In particular I'm not yet used to declaring everything that I'm doing, or in responding to things in a timely manner, so people would declare attackers, I'd be like, "Uh?  Okay," and then they'd just go on and attack before I realized that that was the time I was supposed to tap things out with Avacynian Priest so that they wouldn't deal me damage.<br /><br />Cool.<br /><br />Things to remember for next time:<br /><ul><li>One drops are important for constructed decks, but not really for limited decks, I guess.  I imagine that's because getting your "fatty creatures" out is more successful in the long run than nicking away at someone at the beginning of the game?  Those Selfless Cathars and Doomed Travelers sure came in handy, though.</li>  <li>Geistflame and Feeling of Dread were so useful, <em>wow</em>.  The first because it's so low cost and has Flashback, which means I have potential removal <em>twice</em>.  The second because it really seemed to frustrate people when I used it, haha.</li>  <li>A better deck will have a good focus, i.e. if you decide on getting things like Lumberknot, keep in mind that you will want to kill creatures, and pick out cards accordingly.</li>  <li><a href="http://www.magicdraftsim.com/">Practice more!</a></li>  </ul></div>

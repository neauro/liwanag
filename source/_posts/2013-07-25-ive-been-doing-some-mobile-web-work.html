<div class="p1">I'm unenthusiastic when it comes to designing websites for small screens like phones, probably because I don't have a smartphone. (No particular reason why — just that my 6-year-old palm-sized brick of a phone is sturdy and unexciting to steal, and I plan on staying with it as long as it stays with me.)</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><a href="http://jquerymobile.com/">jQuery Mobile</a>&nbsp;is what I've been learning recently; it is a "mobile framework" and "HTML5-based user interface system," which means that you can</div><ul class="ul1"><li class="li1">stick it in your project</li><li class="li1">throw in some common "mobile" UI elements like headers and buttons, or even switches</li><li class="li1">have those buttons be styled to look pretty good already!</li></ul><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Function-wise, you can also use jQuery Mobile to</div><ul class="ul1"><li class="li1"><a href="http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/pages/page-transitions.html">transition very prettily between pages and dialog boxes</a></li><li class="li1">easily support <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4176844/can-someone-explain-the-html5-aria-attribute">ARIA attributes</a>&nbsp;for better accessibility across your UI elements</li></ul><br />jQuery mobile was confusing for me at first because I would write simple markup, but when viewing it online, my bare elements would suddenly have tons upon tons of classes — a div with a class of <code>mobile-header</code>, for example, would suddenly be a div with the classes <code>mobile-header ui-header ui-bar-a</code>, and would also have a <code>data-role="header"</code> as well. Links in my <code>mobile-header</code> would have also been transformed into elements with tons of classes: <code>icon ui-btn-left ui-btn ui-btn-up-a ui-shadow ui-btn-corner-all</code>…<br /><br /><div class="p1">Which brings me to my next point about jQuery Mobile: it is a <i>pain</i> to style into your theme. Because elements can be so deeply nested, it's hard to figure out what exactly is making all of my links black when they should be blue, and so on. Trying to make a link blue may require that you overwrite not just one style but two. jQuery provides a <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/themeroller/index.php">theme roller</a>&nbsp;which you can use to change the default black style downloaded in the package, but as the things I want to make are radically different than the rounded, chrome buttons they offer, a theme roller doesn't help much.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Regarding getting started, I found that <a href="http://thehungrycoder.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/jquery-mobile-part-1-making-your-first-mobile-page.html">this blog post</a>&nbsp;and the ones following were quite helpful. Additionally, this link on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/bryanrieger/rethinking-the-mobile-web-by-yiibu">Rethinking the mobile web</a>&nbsp;is a great primer on why developing for the mobile web is important (despite all my eye-rolling/teeth-gnashing) and gives data and another perspective on "mobile-first" design processes.</div></div>

A couple weeks ago I visited Portland with Andou's family. I had really wanted to visit a couple restaurants (<a href="http://www.portlandmonthlymag.com/blogs/eat-beat/caf-velo-lauretta-jeans-pie-heaven-september-2011/">Lauretta Jean's</a> in particular) but they were all closed for the holidays. Alas.<br /><br />Portland seems well known for its <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2011/03/portland_leads_us_cities_in_bi.html">bike-friendly streets</a>&nbsp;but when I went there what I first noticed were the recycling bins, which are quite different than the metal blue ones here in Seattle, <a href="http://www.danielmoorephoto.com/Urban-Scenes/Seattle-Walk-About/9465985_6nv5LQ/2/635124291_dNNLh#!i=635124291&amp;k=dNNLh">which are cylindrical and have a&nbsp;</a><a href="http://www.danielmoorephoto.com/Urban-Scenes/Seattle-Walk-About/9465985_6nv5LQ/2/635124291_dNNLh#!i=635124291&amp;k=dNNLh">strange blooming shape on top</a>. &nbsp;Seattle recycling bins also look like they're comprised of slats of metal, but between them you can see only black -- not like Portland's recycling bin, which bares its bowels.<br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-lS-t3ev1EVM/TwHxo8zM0jI/AAAAAAAAAlM/oni_Nw9odgw/s640/blogger-image--2061979078.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-lS-t3ev1EVM/TwHxo8zM0jI/AAAAAAAAAlM/oni_Nw9odgw/s640/blogger-image--2061979078.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">all these beautiful buildings around us,<br />and i'm taking pictures of a recycling bin</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I really like them, because:<br /><ol><li>The "input" areas are varied. &nbsp;Seattle only has a circle to indicate disposal of cans and bottles; this bin has regions not just for cans but also paper. &nbsp;If there's one thing I've learned about design, it's that people don't read, but rather will respond to something by the way that it looks -- circles and rectangles for bottles and cans and newspaper are more subconsciously compelling than text signs (though those are here too, obviously).</li><li>The way you can see into the bin exposes a sort of accountability for the things that are in there, and might end up encouraging a sort of bandwagon effect too -- look at all the other people recycling! &nbsp;<i>Everybody's </i>doing it! &nbsp;(On the other hand, even I can see clearly that not everything in this bin is recyclable, so I guess it could work the other way around too: a passerby may notice that there's styrofoam junk in there and just throw in more styrofoam because, hey, <i>everybody's</i>&nbsp;doing it!)</li><li>Seeing your can/bottle in there provides better feedback for your earth-saving habits -- or at least more than if you had just tossed it into an opaque black cylinder.</li></ol><div>I wonder if Portland has any data about whether these bins are more successful than the previous iteration of recycling bins.</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FubFZjCftFo/TwfCTl8BroI/AAAAAAAAAlw/WtZPzkdviTc/s1600/13943360356611e1abb01231381b65e3_7.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FubFZjCftFo/TwfCTl8BroI/AAAAAAAAAlw/WtZPzkdviTc/s320/13943360356611e1abb01231381b65e3_7.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">portland itself was very nice, by the way</td></tr></tbody></table></div>

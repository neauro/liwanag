For my birthday weekend (some month ago now), I went all-out and scoured my hometown until I found the last remaining Animal Crossing Nintendo 3DS bundle, tucked away in the back of the Toys R Us game section.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">I've never played an Animal Crossing game and have to admit that the lack of farming bewildered me. <i>What? How can I really enjoy personalizing and caring for my world if I'm not diligently watering radishes every day? </i>Even when I started, I doubted I would really enjoy playing such a weird-looking human (the eyes too bright; the lower eyelashes so long!) rather than a cool, adorable animal. I started playing and suddenly it was two and a half hours later, exactly. (I know because of the 3DS Activity Log.)</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">So, what <i>is </i>compelling? For me, it's the exploration: being new to the franchise, every swing of the net or fishing pole in the first couple weeks brought me something new and cool to look at, and I imagine this capitalistic wandering is something like what my childhood would have been like if I had been a boy, or allowed outside to play and examine the foliage around my house. Though I'm sure I'll exhaust the novelty at some point, there's also, like Harvest Moon, a sense of <i>ichigo ichie </i>that brings a preciousness even to the cicadas that are fucking everywhere, just because they'll only be here until about mid-September or so — and then I'll have brand new things to check out.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1"><i>New Leaf </i>also does a fantastic job of connecting you to other people, in part through the capabilities of the 3DS, which I've never appreciated until now. Through the camera, you can share and import designs that other people have made, pixel-art style, including outfits from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-leaf/QR_Codes">Attack on Titan and Zelda</a> games and paths you can lay down to mimic having more&nbsp;<a href="http://newleafpatterns.tumblr.com/post/55173572156">water</a> in your town.</div><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1">Additionally, entire towns or houses can be shared through the "Dreamsuite" or through Streetpass; the former I've used to visit some uncomfortably terrifying towns (such as the infamous Aika and Hitokui), and the latter I'm excited to use each night when I get back home, perusing the homes of people I've passed throughout the day and hoping for good furniture to hoard for rooms I don't have yet. (Thus far I have both a "backyard" room and a "kaitenzushi and pastry restaurant" room planned…)</div><div class="p1"><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4XJdiXu1r8c/Uec75b8J2QI/AAAAAAAADt8/iDV0OAEbbpw/s1600/HNI_0087.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4XJdiXu1r8c/Uec75b8J2QI/AAAAAAAADt8/iDV0OAEbbpw/s1600/HNI_0087.JPG" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">hito in...hitokui @__@<br />("kui" means "to eat")</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1">Part of this novelty is the 3DS's Streetpass itself — my digital headnod at the three people I Streetpass every morning on the bus — and part of it is just the weird delight of meeting people backward and inside-out — knowing, for example, that a fellow commuter is a strict interior designer and Nintendo fan (as shown by their vivid prize room), or that another also loves Attack on Titan (as shown by their "Scouting Legion" painting), before I know either of their names or genders.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">I'm not too much of a social gamer — I don't like playing competitively, and prefer to play games when I am completely alone — but I appreciate this variety of socialness, or rather not-aloneness, a way to get to interact with and get to know people in a low-stress, low-troll atmosphere.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">I've started reserving&nbsp;<a href="http://neauro.tumblr.com/">my Tumblr</a> for more "slice of life" updates and it's there that you can find more <a href="http://neauro.tumblr.com/tagged/acnl">screenshots of my Shiba adventures</a>, as well as my encounters with my villagers, who are acquiring quite the vocabulary.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gxj-vKhwHM8/Uec6tGQ5r7I/AAAAAAAADtw/GsYAGZyo68M/s1600/tumblr_moxg28e8Tq1qdycalo1_400.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gxj-vKhwHM8/Uec6tGQ5r7I/AAAAAAAADtw/GsYAGZyo68M/s1600/tumblr_moxg28e8Tq1qdycalo1_400.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Julian is my favorite villager</td></tr></tbody></table></div>

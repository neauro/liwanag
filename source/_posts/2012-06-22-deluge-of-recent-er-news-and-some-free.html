What have I been up to recently? Namely:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YYkNq4aUJU4/T9qGUiOSyGI/AAAAAAAAA1o/Y-Gt500Is48/s1600/shibacm2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="347" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YYkNq4aUJU4/T9qGUiOSyGI/AAAAAAAAA1o/Y-Gt500Is48/s640/shibacm2.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">vim, and the <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/sfshiba">shiba inu puppy cam</a></td></tr></tbody></table><br />My first larger-scale game project drew to an "official" close last Friday ("official" meaning "It's actually going to be debugged and stuff for the next couple weeks, but for sanity purposes, it's 'done'"). Also last Friday was the end of spring quarter, in which I took a class about empirical research and learned some fundamental but important things like, <i>qualitative research is not meant to be judged on its external validity, but rather it's transferability.</i>&nbsp;The former is the extent to which findings can be "generalized" to the broader world; the latter is the extent to which findings may be found under certain limitations and settings, which have to be defined by the researchers. Subtle.<br /><br />I've also been playing a lot of Diablo 3, despite my deep discomfort with the fact that the only playable dark-skinned character is a witch doctor. Like -- really? <i>Witch doctor?</i>&nbsp;The only playable black person is a spasming, exotified mush of skull masks and voodoo-flavored equips? When this is brought up in conversation circles the immediately following statement always seems to be, <i>But, but the (spoilers) fallen angel of justice is black,</i>&nbsp;as if this suddenly makes witch doctor okay, and I guess it's soothing if what's important is that the games you play be falsely "perfect" enough to not be worth critical analysis.<br /><br />That being said, I'm still enjoying <strike>my social slot machine pinata game</strike> Diablo, though the amount of enjoyment dims a bit into grimacing cynicism every time I find an article about its psychological trickery, <a href="http://www.psychologyofgames.com/2012/06/the-psychology-of-diablo-iii-loot-part-1-anchoring-the-auction-house/">like this one</a>.<br /><br />Since it came out recently, and since my next project (and conceivably all future projects from now on) involve free-to-play games, I've also been playing Nimblebit's recently released Pocket Planes to see what I can glean from its charming pixelated ailerons. &nbsp;In Pocket Planes, you construct your very own airline empire, overseeing the passage of travelers and unusual cargo from city to city.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HE6RKZhOzew/T-UPXNKS8-I/AAAAAAAABNM/-lXQ2VVwMY0/s1600/photo+(2).PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="425" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HE6RKZhOzew/T-UPXNKS8-I/AAAAAAAABNM/-lXQ2VVwMY0/s640/photo+(2).PNG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">my plane, named "faire," since the colors seemed kinda fair-like</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">In particular I was struggling with how I could make an "ecosystem" of goals, something that wouldn't require an endless content feed or "leveling up," some system that could provide its player prodding naturally and grow without much goading and prodding on my part. &nbsp;Something that's nice about Pocket Planes is that, whenever you view the map, you see your "goals:" all those faded-out cities.</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: right;"></div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UOydUvvtrSY/T-UPWVmPETI/AAAAAAAABNE/FO1RT3b_qOk/s1600/photo+(1).PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="425" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UOydUvvtrSY/T-UPWVmPETI/AAAAAAAABNE/FO1RT3b_qOk/s640/photo+(1).PNG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">seoul, i will get you soon enough</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I recently tried Kairosoft's recent Epic Astro Story as well, and it had the same sort of carrot-dangling -- faded out areas with rocket ships and caves waiting to explore. In some ways I feel like it's more fun to decide where you want to expand into as well, given the little bit of information. &nbsp;Maybe it's also ~*intrinsic*~, since you know that you're getting <i>something</i>&nbsp;when you expand, but there's still a surprise and mystery concerning what you can do with it.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2evvfoNGiVM/T-UPX62K-lI/AAAAAAAABNU/6TWOKJeezhw/s1600/photo.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2evvfoNGiVM/T-UPX62K-lI/AAAAAAAABNU/6TWOKJeezhw/s400/photo.PNG" width="266" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">screenshot of epic astro story, lite version</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Something that I like about both games is that they have warm little cores of personalization/personality. In Pocket Planes, you can color your planes how you like, you can name them, you can outfit their pilots so they have unexpectedly bright facial hair, you can bring the Rosetta Stone from Nagasaki to Sendai, you can bring an ambiguously George Washington-dressed person to Vladivostok. &nbsp;In Epic Astro Story, you have individual citizens with their own names and their own households and preferences. &nbsp;It's the sort of thing that I'm having a hard time finding a parallel for for the amusement park simulation, since amusement parks don't really have little fictional people with natural needs (like work/leisure/exploration) to inhabit them.<br /><br />Recently one of my coworkers admitted that he had never been to Disneyland and was going in the near future, and as soon as people found out they've been taking time to cross vast distances to reach his desk, after which some thirty minutes to an hour will be spent bestowing upon said coworker nostalgic stories and adamant recommendations about Disneyland. &nbsp;"<i>I remember the first time I did X, I felt so [scared/excited/happy]...it's been years now but I really want to go back!"</i>&nbsp;I wish I could capture this sense of excitement, this sort of <i>exuberant memory essence </i>for this amusement park game, but I haven't yet been able to come up with much except perhaps randomly generated events where a little fake visitor will say, "I remember visiting this Fun Bounce in my youth, I love it!"<br /><br />I kind of wish I could visit Disneyland again just to see if inspiration would strike.</div>

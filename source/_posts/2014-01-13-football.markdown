This past weekend I finally learned about football, something I've never been terribly interested in. The most recent game I watched was Kind Of A Big Deal for the city I live in.

It strikes me that football is an incredibly fun game to watch because the "four downs" system provides a multitude of little goals to rejoice about. Each play is rife with struggle, with a victory that can turn into loss in an instant. It reminds me of Mark Rosewater's description of <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/174">interaction and a catch-up feature</a> as things that "every game needs." At each "down," both teams have the potential not just to stop each other, but to improve their own standing. It's a powerful interval.

Watching the game this past weekend was the first time in my life that I really, finally <em>got</em> it. I didn't know there were separate offensive and defensive teams; I didn't know that there were people whose singular jobs were to run, or to kick, and that the had individual tutors. It's pretty inspiring.

For whatever reason, <a href="http://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> is becoming my social media site of choice, probably because its humor appeals to me so much. I also love that it supports people easily creating blogs that cater to specific topics -- like <a href="http://medievalpoc.tumblr.com/">people of color in medieval art</a>, or <a href="http://moviecode.tumblr.com/">source code in TV and films</a>, or <a href="http://tabcloseddidntread.com/">intrusive pop-ups</a>.

Anyway, I've made my own tumblr for gathering examples of <a href="http//delightful-ux.tumblr.com">delightful user experience</a>, which is my main interest when it comes to the wide world of human-centered design. Even though I love it, I'm still muddy on what comprises a delightful user experience, and thus far have tossed in examples of <a href="http://adobe.breach.il.ly/#/about">useful websites with friendly wording</a>, as well as <a href="http://delightful-ux.tumblr.com/post/71660750263/hells-pizza-coffin-box-new-zealand-based-hell">pizza box designs with unnecessary but awesome utility</A>, and <a href="http://delightful-ux.tumblr.com/post/71681828062/australian-sharks-send-tweets-to-warn-swimmers">sharks with Twitter accounts</a>.

For now, when deciding whether to add an example, I ask myself, "Could this Thing accomplish what it currently accomplishes, but in a more boring way?" Or, "Does this Thing solve for an action that is not-that-fun to do?" And if the answer to either is "yes!" — lo, thusly do I deem it delightful.

I understand that second question might still catch Things that are not entirely playful — but I'm not going to stress out about differentiating between design that's good and design that fulfills some nebulously defined good feel.

If you have encountered a good feel recently yourself, feel free to <a href="http://delightful-ux.tumblr.com/submit">submit</a>!

<br />I've recently come into the bittersweet situation in which I am too busy actually doing things to write about them.<br /><br />In particular, since my new job at Fugazo reimbursed me for an iPod Touch, I have been playing tons of games on it, as well as exploring this previously mysterious world of being able to take pictures or video of whatever I want to on the fly.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OMKiFF1sHwg/ToecxPNVHVI/AAAAAAAAAdc/SSzbWDm5rh0/s1600/tumblr_ls8ry5Bjz11qdycalo1_1280.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OMKiFF1sHwg/ToecxPNVHVI/AAAAAAAAAdc/SSzbWDm5rh0/s320/tumblr_ls8ry5Bjz11qdycalo1_1280.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">not that my iPod is as good as my 35mm</span></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><h3>Hot Springs Story</h3>The first game that I ended up actually purchasing was <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/id408854559">Hot Springs Story</a> (or, "SpaVille," according to Andou).  It was developed by Kairosoft, which also made <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/game-dev-story/id396085661?mt=8">Game Dev Story</a>, beloved by so many real game developers.  I didn't like Game Dev Story too much, but was immediately hooked by Hot Springs Story, due in the majority to this screenshot from <a href="http://toucharcade.com/2011/03/03/hot-springs-story-review/">Touch Arcade</a><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SscUwZBoLSE/ToefLRaWnTI/AAAAAAAAAdk/OWbpgtd5Vz0/s1600/mzl.pniydziy.320x480-75.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="214" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SscUwZBoLSE/ToefLRaWnTI/AAAAAAAAAdk/OWbpgtd5Vz0/s320/mzl.pniydziy.320x480-75.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="http://toucharcade.com/2011/03/03/hot-springs-story-review/">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />In Game Dev Story, you start out in a full, gray, square office.  In Hot Springs Story, you start out in this hardwood- and tatami-floor building which is both surrounded and filled by all these trees and blossoming plants which change their appearance throughout the season.  It's also, to me, filled with less complexity in the beginning of the game; in GDS you're immediately given all these options about what programmer to hire for your project, and all the potential programmers have all these different skills, and it's so confusing.  What do these skills even mean yet?!<br /><br />HSS is pretty similar -- a lot of the small icons aren't understandable and a lot of the mechanics are something you grow into or discover later in game (for example, what "compatible facilities" are and what they do), but in HSS it felt a little more forgiving to make mistakes in the beginning.  The feeling of productivity also came more easily in HSS; you could set down trees and see the happy little "Scenery increased!" pop-ups, or else see people come in and level up in satisfaction, and so forth.<br /><br />I also started giving Pocket Academy a try today, but like GDS it has such a variety of options and "chances of messing up" from the very beginning that it almost stresses me out to play. Thanks to HSS, though, I think I'm getting the hang of Pocket Academy's rules more easily, and I do like that Pocket Academy allows you to have a more personal connection with gameworld entities.  In HSS every guest is a faceless instance of a catergory of customers -- a "Hiker," a "Young Couple" -- but in Pocket Academy every student and teacher has a name and a set of strengths and weaknesses which are all level-up-able.  You can even see which students are friends with which!  It's a veritable Dwarf Fortress.<br /><br /><br /><h3>The Secret of Chateau de Moreau</h3><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mgiYp9F5XNs/Toer10BUzVI/AAAAAAAAAds/LP1UbeMdSVo/s1600/Chateau-De-Moreau1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="142" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mgiYp9F5XNs/Toer10BUzVI/AAAAAAAAAds/LP1UbeMdSVo/s320/Chateau-De-Moreau1.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="http://ifanzine.com/the-secret-of-chateau-de-moreau-giveaway-2-10-itunes-gift-cards-up-for-grabs">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Chateau de Moreau went on sale recently and after seeing something in a review to the effect of "this game is like Phoenix Wright" I grabbed it immediately.  It's essentially an adventure game wrapped around a mystery.  The Count, your adoptive father, is dead; can you prove that you, the apparent inheritor of all his wealth, didn't murder him?  It's quite like Phoenix Wright in the conversations you get to have with characters and the dinner scenes each night, which are like the court scenes in Ace Attorney.  The characters are interesting to get to know, clich√©d as some of them are (The Responsible Eldest Son, The Cheerful/Ditzy Maid).  My only problem with it thus far is that it's too hard to move around the chateau using a touchscreen -- I wish I could just click rooms and head directly to them, instead of clumsily moving the character through this sparse black-and-white overhead map step by step.  In fact, why does there need to be a map in the first place?  In the two hours that I've played the game thus far I can't think of one instance in which I thought, <em>Wow, this is a great use of an overhead map that is nothing but white lines and text on a black background.</em><br /><br />The mansion has a ton of rooms, but only a subset of them are unlocked and actually visit-able in each chapter.  So why even show those other rooms?  Is the sense of the largeness of the chateau worth conveying hand-in-hand with the frustration that comes when all but four of the rooms of that huge chateau are inexplicably locked?<br /><br /><br /><br /><h3>Sword and Sworcery</h3><br /><br /><center><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="265" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/10066962?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="400"></iframe><br /><a href="http://vimeo.com/10066962">Walk in the Woods</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/sworcery">Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery </a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a></center><br /><br /><a href="http://evolutionlive.blogspot.com/">Alex</a> has been encouraging me to play this game for its <a href="http://onlyagame.typepad.com/brainhex/seeker.html">Seeker</a> quality unusual to iOS games.  It is the type of game that is fun to just "<em>be</em> in" -- to look at that calm forest all pixelated and yet somehow filled with so much depth.  The dialogue and world-building is also hilarious at times.  Scythians, dude.  They hate those rainbows.</div>

<div class='post'>
I had a Rails work party with Joshu the other night (after which Rosanna served us basil-pesto pasta and lamb steak) and now I just want to do EVERYTHING IN RAILS.  It is SO COOL.  It's so easy to work with databases and set everything up....eeeeek &lt;3<br /><br /><span class="shh">Why am I taking operating systems when what I really want to do is just make sleek Rails apps/portfolio things .____.</span><br /><br />My main resources are <a href="http://railsforzombies.org/">Rails for Zombies</a> (a pretty site with cute, intelligible tutorials and nice lab sessions <span class="shh">which I mostly skipped, but, whatever</span>) and Kelly, who's the best. :D<br /><br />Once I can figure out something to really make, and once I figure out how to get <a href="http://heroku.com">heroku</a> working, this world is going to be so much more fun.</div>

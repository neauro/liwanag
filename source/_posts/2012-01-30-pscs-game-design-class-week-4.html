<i>This quarter I am facilitating a game design class at Puget Sound Community School for fun and lols. &nbsp;This is my story.</i><br /><br /><i>Other weeks can be found <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/search/label/pscs">here</a>.</i><br /><br />I'm a little belated with this post, if not just because I personally felt "meh" about it (which probably means that it might have been worse for the students themselves). &nbsp;Firstly, we critiqued Making Monkeys.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eyjfrSSrYVU/Tyd9DbYC5xI/AAAAAAAAAoc/HBrzqgLtUhs/s1600/makingmonkeys.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="460" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eyjfrSSrYVU/Tyd9DbYC5xI/AAAAAAAAAoc/HBrzqgLtUhs/s640/makingmonkeys.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">screenshot of making monkeys, by <a href="http://greg-anims.com/">greg-anims</a></td></tr></tbody></table><br />The general consensus was that it was fun, unique, challenging. &nbsp;We pointed out the nice progression of the levels -- each one had something new to learn -- and talked about the types of rewards and goals in the design: the short-term win of the coffee cup, the long-term win of the entire game with your progress laid out visibly. &nbsp;The little narratives acted as both a silly reward for the previous level and a hint for the upcoming level. &nbsp;Some students found bugs but I didn't write any of them down, so they're Lost in Time and Space now.<br /><br />I couldn't think of a topic that I felt like discussing, so I chose <a href="http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2006/03/performance_met.html">this article</a> at random from a list of game design resources <a href="http://evolutionlive.blogspot.com/">Alex</a> gave me and just tried to talk about it, whiteboard and all. &nbsp;It was not too compelling and people were distracted, probably because "me talking" wasn't that intriguing.<br /><br />I switched topics then to the difference between "hardcore" and "casual" gaming, just to see what people thought of it (again referencing <a href="http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2007/08/game-literacy.html">another article from Only a Game</a>). &nbsp;Some of the students were adamant that the labels didn't mean anything, that "people just love games" and stereotypes seek to destroy the simple, human integrity of us all, to which I agree, kinda. &nbsp;I've always felt something snubby about declarations of <i>I'm a hardcore gamer </i>when all the game companies I've worked at have legitimate, game-loving audiences who can play just as much as any COD player, just doesn't relish the violence or complexity of it.<br /><br />An interesting term I learned in relation to the hardcore/casual duality was the idea of "game literacy;" that maybe an important delineation between hardcore and casual is not necessarily the time spent playing, or the motivations, but the breadth of game knowledge in general, and the ease with which one could pick up another game.<br /><br />Another idea was "game depth," and I tried to tie this together with ideas of winning and losing from earlier -- what happens in games when you "never really lose," but just have opportunities to achieve better, a la Angry Birds? &nbsp;What kind of decisions can you make in a game that is shallow, and one that has depth? &nbsp;How important are those decisions to the game itself? &nbsp;In Angry Birds, you can choose your angle and your velocity; in Tetris, your rotatation and speed; in a game like Magic, you can choose your deck, your strategy, your technique. &nbsp;It always seems like games with depth are "better," but I adore Limbo and concede that it's shallow gameplay-wise -- you solve the puzzles, you get to the end, that's it. &nbsp;I love story, but "Game" in its unique form is something that can be cooked and devoured a thousand times and still taste different the thousand and first.</div>

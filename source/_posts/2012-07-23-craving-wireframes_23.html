<div class='post'>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UOK1u90PvxE/UAY-27akyRI/AAAAAAAABuw/sbJA9KIYHlg/s1600/craving.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="308" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UOK1u90PvxE/UAY-27akyRI/AAAAAAAABuw/sbJA9KIYHlg/s400/craving.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />These are mock-ups from an idea I had two years ago, for a website that would aggregate photos people took of food at restaurants. The idea was that if you were hungry, but not sure what exactly you wanted to eat, you could just sit here and click <i>Random picture!</i>&nbsp;until you saw something sufficiently appetizing, nearby, and cheap.<br /><br />The first thing to do was to make sure that this idea wasn't already done. Looking around, we (me and <a href="http://joshuahou.com/">Joshua Hou</a>, my then partner) turned up a couple similar sites, including:<br /><br /><ul><li><b>Yelp</b>: the obvious comparison. But, though at the time it incorporated user-contributed photos of food, it didn't do it to the extent that we wanted to support it.</li><li><b>Google Hotpot</b>: newly released at the time, but, despite its food-related name, still not all about photos of food.</li></ul><br />The main task that I wanted to support foremost was, <i>Look at pictures of food, and see where they are.</i>&nbsp;For that reason, the two main things on the front page are some random featured food (indicated by numeral 1), and a map (numeral 3). You can also specify and limit what area food is shown from (numeral 6).<br /><br />The other main task here is <i>Find a specific kind of food,</i>&nbsp;which is supported by the search bar at the top of the page.<br /><br />Another aspect of the site is the ability to comment and rate dishes -- but since this should really be secondary to "Look at delicious things!" it's limited to ratings on a five-star scale, and a short description.<br /><br />Views of specific dishes (the wireframe on the bottom-left) show all the photos associated with the dish, as well as comments and ratings. Views of specific restaurants show all photos associated with the dishes at that restaurant, with the idea that a restaurant-specific page would become a crowdsourced visual menu. Which brings me to one question that I have about the concept of this site: how does having photos of food affect the stakeholders here? Fancy restaurants seem fond of depicting menu items with a variety of delicious buzzwords and nothing else, and when you, as the diner, finally receive your food, part of the pleasure is the surprise of seeing what it looks like. Along with general usability testing, questions like this would be part of "next steps" for this design.</div>

I always said before that I was busy with school but it doesn't compare at all to the amount of work I have now, just a couple weeks until graduation. AAAAHHH

Lots has been happening. Even so, I've been posting pretty frequently on <a href="http://neauro.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> (as it requires less effort and being able to arrange photos nicely is fun).

In particular I've been working on my Capstone project, Bubble, an app to faciliate easier sharing of photos and messages between iPhone users using mesh networking (the same kind that <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/525921/the-latest-chat-app-for-iphone-needs-no-internet-connection/">Firechat</a> has been making use of). I've been writing about my team's progress in our own <a href="http://hcdeevee.tumblr.com/">process blog</a>, and I've also posted <a href="http://neauro.tumblr.com/tagged/code-eevee">in-progress stuff</a> about my own sketches and experiments with Sketch 3 and Flinto. Sketch 3 is fantastic, and I find myself opening it even when I just need to do a couple quick photo edits. Flinto is also great, though I'm disappointed that I'll probably never "really" use it after my trial runs out, because $20 a month is a little much for someone who just wants to play with flows that I won't get paid for. I wish there was a way to pay up front and only have one active project or something. As it is, I'm keeping an eye on <a href="http://proto.io/">Proto.io</a> and <a href="https://marvelapp.com/">Marvel App</a> for future playing. (Though I still loove <a href="https://popapp.in/">Pop App</a> right now for interactive paper prototyping.)

Other than capstone work, I've also been working on a lot of fun design projects for my Interaction Design class this quarter, which I'll post about separately later.

I've also been writing a ton! A month ago the "Plague" theme edition of <a href="http://strayingfromreality.wordpress.com/">AU</a> was released, which had my story *Iron &amp; Honey*. It's available currently at Bulldog News.

I've also been working on my Big Story with greater headway than I have before by using the "writing scene-by-scene" technique which I read about in <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=story+robert+mckee+&oq=story+robert+mckee+&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i59l4j0.2336j0j1&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-8"><em>Story</em> by Robert McKee</a>. The way that I’m executing is by writing out each scene with a “beginning state” of certain characters, their “ending” state, and the exposition or other “feeling” work that needs to also happen.

My problem with Big Story is that I love my world and my characters and I know what I want to say, but I have no idea how to say it, and no idea how to get from my known point A to point B. Hopefully working out each step like this will help me actually get somewhere. I’ve had problems dragging mindlessly from A to B with all my previous iterations, but with this kind of technique I can already feel myself becoming more conscious of how to make making meaningful things happen the whole way through.

The final major happening in my life is the release of <a href="http://supergiantgames.com/index.php/transistor/">Transistor</a>! (≧▽≦ I spent the Monday prior its release this week listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KudXO0DO04U&feature=youtu.be&t=5m42s">We All Become</a> on repeat, more of a fangirl about this than any other game than I can think of. I'm about 4 hours in and have already had a heart-swelling experience that reduced me into a puddle of sap. I'm not done yet but I love it I love it and it's incredibly inspiring. I can only hope the good feels stay until the end.

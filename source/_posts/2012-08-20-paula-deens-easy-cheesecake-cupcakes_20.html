Given my limited store of ingredients, we went with cheesecake, that being the type of cupcake that requires little investment in terms of icing and ingredients that I didn't posses.<br /><br />The recipe is sourced from what I now realize is <a href="http://www.kraftrecipes.com/recipes/paula-deens-easy-cheesecake-120241.aspx">Kraft's Recipes</a>. We changed the butter extract to vanilla extract. The recipe is for 12 cupcakes, but we ended up making around 18. Also, we ended up not putting any jam or anything on the cupcakes, but they were quite sweet on their own.<br /><br /><b>Ingredients</b><br /><ol><li>2 pkg. (8 oz. each) cream cheese, softened</li><li>1 cup granulated sugar</li><li>1 tsp. vanilla extract</li><li>2 &nbsp;eggs</li><li>12 vanilla wafers</li><li>1 cup seedless raspberry jam</li><li>1pt. fresh raspberries</li><li>2 tbsp. powdered sugar for dusting</li></ol><div><br /></div><div><b>Instructions</b></div><div><div><ol><li>Place a paper cupcake liner in each of 18 muffin cups.</li><li>Beat cream cheese until fluffy. Add granulated sugar and butter extract, beating well. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li><li>Place a vanilla wafer, flat-side down, in each muffin cup. Spoon cream cheese mixture over wafers, until paper lining is about 3/4ths filled. Bake for 20 minutes.</li><li>Allow tarts to cool completely. When cool, top each cheesecake cupcake with 1/2 Tbsp. of raspberry jam and fresh raspberries. Dust with powdered sugar.</li></ol><br />Since the vanilla wafers we bought were a little too small for the paper liner, we experimented with making half the liners filled with whole wafers, and half with crushed. (By the way -- vanilla wafers are easily crushed by placing them inside a glass mixing bowl, and mashing them with the flat bottom of another glass.)</div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Unu9_hZ3afA/UDJpVbnjmSI/AAAAAAAACRQ/6U1WFs44JZ8/s1600/DSC_0002%2B%25282%2529.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Unu9_hZ3afA/UDJpVbnjmSI/AAAAAAAACRQ/6U1WFs44JZ8/s640/DSC_0002%2B%25282%2529.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />In the end, the crushed wafers ended up quite crumbly, so whole wafers really are probably the way to go.</div></div>

One hundred and eighty voices - male and female, young and old, from all walks of life and all over the country - talk intimately to the reader. Combining great humor and pathos this remarkable selection of stories from the thousands submitted to NPR's Weekend <i>All Things Considered</i> National Story Project gives the reader a glimpse of America's soul in all its diversity.</blockquote><br /><div class="p1"><i>I Thought My Father was God </i>is a compilation of short stories submitted by listeners to NPR's National Story Project, and is fantastic. The events of each story are poignant in their mundanity; the fact that some of these stories were carried throughout the years and then threaded into words gives them a special impact, even if the events themselves are ordinary.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">I was the third to be passed this book, after S and A, who read it over the course of several weeks. They found the stories too emotionally heavy to read more than a handful at a time; I found them too delicious to restrain myself. Each story is a good example of how small moments in someone's life can resonate through years, through actions, through all parts of you; each one reminds me of the impact my own actions can make, however small, and reminds me the the lives of people around me are larger than the glances we exchange as we pass by on the sidewalk.</div><br /><div class="p1">My favorite story is <i>Iceman of Market Street</i>, especially given recent discussions about <a href="http://grist.org/cities/the-dark-side-of-startup-city/">the dark side of San Francisco's transformations</a>.</div></div>

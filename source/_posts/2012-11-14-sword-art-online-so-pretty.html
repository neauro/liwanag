So I found a gifset of Sword Art Online on Tumblr and decided that I wanted to watch it, because the art is pretty and also because the characters looked familiar, probably because Sword Art Online is one of the light novels I bought (and subsequently lost) some time ago.  <br /><br />Well, no matter!<br /><br />Sword Art Online (SAO) details the adventures of Kirito, who is one of ten thousand players trapped in the newly-released "virtual reality" MMORPG of the same name. The creator of SAO, who turns out to be some kind of eccentric psychopath, removes the "Log Out" button on the first day of open play and announces that everyone will have to reach and defeat Floor 100 in order to return back to the Real World. In the meantime, if you die in the game, you die in real life.<br /><br />I was excited because Kirito has bangs (my favorite ridiculous anime hair affectation) and spends the opening looking Dark and Tormented (my favorite ridiculous anime stereotype). Additionally, the "main" female character, Asuna, appears in the opening running around and doing things.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SVwGKD2OF2Y/UKRq787wvXI/AAAAAAAACyY/FAquBkYgszk/s1600/sao.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="387" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SVwGKD2OF2Y/UKRq787wvXI/AAAAAAAACyY/FAquBkYgszk/s640/sao.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">go, asuna, go! clear that low bar of agency!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />[spoilers ahead]<br /><br />Inevitably this first season was full of the same old tired female character stereotypes/storylines/actions, including but not limited to:<br /><br /><ul><li>female characters that basically act as pretty receptacles and mirrors for Kirito's feelings, for example:</li><ul><li>Silica, Dragon Tamer Girl: who appeared for one episode to be Kirito's "little sister," with bonus panicked upskirts</li><li>Lisbeth, Smith Girl: who appeared for one episode to be a love interest that is irrelevant after the one episode</li></ul><li>male characters not caring that female characters don't like them or want to be near them, for example:</li><ul><li>That one guy refuses to stop being Asuna's escort, and says he'll only leave her alone if Kirito wins against him a duel (what)</li><li>The leader of Asuna's guild, who, when Asuna tells him she wants to leave the guild, says she can only leave if Kirito wins against him in a duel (what)</li></ul><li>There's also a sub-plot that involves a woman who is murdered by her husband because, in the life-threatening situation of Sword Art Online, she stopped being "cute and obedient" and became instead a "lively and active" guild leader...<em>what?</em> It's obvious that this particular guy character is horrible, but I guess I'm bewildered by this story, which seemed to come out of nowhere, and didn't really serve to teach any characters about anything. Maybe if at the end Kirito had thought something like, <i>Wow, this really makes me appreciate Asuna's fighting skill more</i>...?</li></ul><br />The things that I <em>did</em> enjoy about this anime were the little game-related details, which take on a "private joke" feeling that I think was delightful and <em>not</em> uncomfortably blatant with fanfare and winking ("Hey! That was a game reference! Get it? Eh? <em>Ehhhh</em>?"). Characters gossip about other characters who have legendary status because their "HP bar has never fallen to yellow." At some point Kirito hits a wall in anger and the wall flashes with a notification -- <code>IMMORTAL OBJECT</code> -- indicating that it's inanimate and&nbsp;indestructible&nbsp; Best part: this little moment turns out to have plot significance later. Whoa! I <em>really</em> appreciate the meaningful subtlety.<br /><br />It's also fun to view what happens to characters as they become trapped in the digital world, though I wish it were explored more, perhaps in lieu of unnecessary female character fanservice. Some people commit suicide; some dedicate themselves to fighting on "the front lines" to free everyone; some people become merchants and smiths to support the fighters. One old man, thinking that he'd never get his real-life job back anyway, decides that he'll perfect in-game fishing.<br /><br />Inevitably Kirito and Asuna fall into a relationship, an unexpectedly intense and serious romance that involves them getting married (in-game) and living together in a cabin in the woods (on the game's Floor 22) and eventually meeting a girl that they "adopt" as their daughter (who later turns out to be a game process AI). Something that's refreshing about their relationship is the trust they have in each other -- Kirito&nbsp;occasionally&nbsp;hangs behind while Asuna fights, and at one point just smiles when someone tries to warn him to get his wife out of the way of a giant attacking fish. Though they were rarer than the opposite, I appreciated the parts where Kirito gave Asuna a place to stand on her own and defend and be appreciated for her actions and thoughts and talents, which weren't all Kirito-centered (for example, her&nbsp;experimentation&nbsp;with cooking and seeing which mixture of in-game loots and essences could make real-world flavors like soy sauce).<br /><br />Given the intensity of their dedication to each other (Kirito declares to Asuna that his entire self belongs to her; Asuna says that if Kirito dies, she'll commit suicide), it's uncomfortable and bewildering why the second season of SAO, which is still on-going, keeps pushing this love triangle forward between Kirito and his sister-who-is-actually-his-cousin. I mean, this isn't going to pan out, right? Is this just an excuse to keep having unrequited romantic (slash incestuous and forbidden) tension in the show to keep people watching? Is devoted love so boring? After all that the two characters have been through together, and after the show gives you so much reason to invest in the semi-doomed lovebank of Kirito/Asuna, it's hard to see this extra, new girl as anything but annoying fan service. <br /><br />Something else a little depressing is the impending descent of Asuna into a caged bird that doesn't do much but stare forlornly into space whenever her captor, a despised fianc√© in a real-world arranged marriage who is keeping her unconscious and trapped in a new MMORPG, comes to threaten her warmly with sexual assault or erasure of her memories. In the most recent episode, Asuna sneakily watched him unlock the door to her cage, which made me assume hopefully that she would try to escape on her own. Unfortunately, she just collapsed on her knees and cried, "Save me, Kirito!"<br /><br />It's not that I blame her for her circumstances or think that she could fight her way out of it if she wanted...I just don't want her to become a full-on damsel in distress. :(<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LxyJxHtHaZ4/UKRswdDNWJI/AAAAAAAACyg/8JOOm1RLdCk/s1600/sao2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="366" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LxyJxHtHaZ4/UKRswdDNWJI/AAAAAAAACyg/8JOOm1RLdCk/s640/sao2.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">low bar of agency: not cleared (<a href="http://kimmygawa.tumblr.com/post/34445253622/weird-guy-that-smell-asunas-hair-made-her-cry">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Having met the end of the anime that's presently out, I've been devouring the light novels, where fanservice-y upskirts are not as prominent and where Asuna is more of an active character during the "fairy" arc, escaping and fighting and doing what she can. As a series the whole thing is&nbsp;<i>really </i>fun to watch -- it's&nbsp;beautiful, and really stretches, embroiders, and <i>uses</i> its theme of video game worlds and realities.</div>

Asuna Yuuki is a heroine and the partner of Kirito in the Sword Art Online series. Her original avatar in <a href="http://www.cosplayfield.com/sword-art-online-alo-c-545_550.html" rel="nofollow">ALfheim Online</a>, was as Fairy Queen, Titania. She wore a white outfit, with a white long skirt, tube top showing her belly, along with a red ribbon that goes around the top part of her top that comes together to make a bow. She goes barefoot, and wears a white strip around her ankles! This <a href="http://www.cosplayfield.com/sao-alfheim-online-asuna-yuuki-cosplay-costume-p-523.html" rel="nofollow">Asuna Yuuki cosplay costume</a> looks like a long dress, and this is why I love it very much!</div>

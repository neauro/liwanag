Nope, it really did start at age 24 when I last checked!  Very strange.  I tried to find that page again when writing this post and couldn&#39;t, can you tell me how you found it yourself?<br /><br />Even if it is &quot;the programming bit&quot; (HAHA) that made us seem more &quot;male&quot; than we are, it still makes me wonder how they calculate a gender binary for certain topics, and what it would take to change it.  With Google, it&#39;s probably not some all-knowing human christening these different, inanimate topics with specific genders :P</div>

I assume you meant 25 to 34 years? I checked my own ad preferences and yup, I was thought of as a male between the ages of 25 and 34 as well. XD Does that mean we have similar interests overall, or is that just because of the programming bit?</div>

In Wicked Plants, Stewart takes on over two hundred of Mother Nature’s most appalling creations. It’s an A to Z of plants that kill, maim, intoxicate, and otherwise offend. You’ll learn which plants to avoid (like exploding shrubs), which plants make themselves exceedingly unwelcome (like the vine that ate the South), and which ones have been killing for centuries (like the weed that killed Abraham Lincoln's mother).</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Menacing botanical illustrations and splendidly ghastly drawings create a fascinating portrait of the evildoers that may be lurking in your own backyard. Drawing on history, medicine, science, and legend, this compendium of bloodcurdling botany will entertain, alarm, and enlighten even the most intrepid gardeners and nature lovers.</i></blockquote><br />I generally adore plants and like hoarding information about them, so this book was super enjoyable for me. The illustrations are beautiful, even the disturbing ones that show fungus growing out of people's nostrils or hands holding bouquets of eyeballs. It's easy to read and the muted textures and colors on the paper made it especially fun somehow -- though I love my Kindle, this particular book wouldn't have been the same in .mobi format. It makes me wonder whether mass paperback of the future will continue to make their niche in an increasingly electronic world by experimenting more in form and color, offering what websites just can't yet.<br /><br />Some interesting finds:<br /><br /><ul><li>Killer Algae: a plant mutated potentially by aquarium UV lights, whose entire body (fronds, stems, and all) comprise <i>one cell</i>. Even so, it apparently covers twelve thousand acres of the ocean floor. <i>What.</i></li><li>Cogon Grass: a grass with "lures fire" with its high flammability and causes it to burn hot on neighboring competition. Cogon seeds then grow afresh and strong from the ashes.</li><li>Sandbox Tree: "The sap is so caustic that it can kill fish or be used as an arrow poison. But you have the most to fear from the fruits, which explode with a loud bang when they are ripe. Its poisonous seeds can fly up to three hundred feet, earning it the nickname 'dynamite tree.'" <i>What.</i></li><li>Celery: &nbsp;apparently, to combat a common fungal predator, celery can produce phototoxic compounds at its root and "farmworkers and handlers of celery routinely get burns on their skin that show up under sunlight..." <i>What.</i></li></ul><div><i><br /></i></div><div>Needless to say, now I feel like every little green thing on the street is just waiting to inject me with deadly neurotoxin.

I played Dear Esther last week, which shouldn't be a surprise since Everyone Is Talking About It. <br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-q64DenBNx5M/T0FszTbcjpI/AAAAAAAAAqc/P5c9ZcTpbSI/s1600/esther1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-q64DenBNx5M/T0FszTbcjpI/AAAAAAAAAqc/P5c9ZcTpbSI/s320/esther1.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">a screenshot near Dear Esther's opening</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">Playing it felt like being in a </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_ride" style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">dark ride</a><span style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"> -- the level guides you along paths worn or fenced, and occasionally you get a glimpse of the "aerial," framed between giant stone features. Going the long way to examine scenery inevitably brings you back to the golden path, which is nice, because backpedaling would have been painful in a game with no running.</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">No running means that there's no way to rush through anything. In some ways being forced to slow down is comforting; rushing has been ingrained in me, rush to wake up, to get to work, to get back, to do homework.  But in this game taking your time is coerced, is allowed. You can slow down to look at the cyan particle spray of ocean waves hitting the shore, to look at the rot-scarred timbers framing stone steps clotted with yellowbloom brush, to look at the mysterious luminescent chemical bonds and electrical diagrams splattered on the walls.</span></div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TgKCtu9j37E/T0Fs2h8Ic5I/AAAAAAAAAqk/5HHiuqOVQo8/s1600/esther2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TgKCtu9j37E/T0Fs2h8Ic5I/AAAAAAAAAqk/5HHiuqOVQo8/s320/esther2.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">a screenshot containing one of those creepy candles that <i>never melted</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br />I have to admit that more than once I wanted to do more than look.  I wanted to pick up the Bible on the ground and see what pages were bookmarked, I wanted to pick up medical instruments from trays of bloody water.  Which is, I guess, why I felt like this game was so much of a dark ride: you play, sitting in your cart, immersed but unable to touch anything.<br /><br />I guess one advantage of being unable to interact with things is that there's less pulling you from the immersion of the environment -- what would picking up a Bible have looked like, after all?  Like a book rising from the ground and opening magically inches from your eyes?  After a while I would have taken it for granted, but something so blatantly game-like would have been jarring the first time, would have reminded me that this world is a game.  A couple times your character acts on his or her own -- near the beginning, you duck to avoid an impromptu seagull -- when you enter dark places, your flashlight flickers on, wordlessly.  At moments like these it was easy to think that you  the player were actually perched on the optic nerves of a very un-curious person, hallucinating a Bri'ish narrator and their descent into madness.<br /><br />A feature of this game is that, though voice-overs are triggered as you make your way to certain areas, some are selected randomly to play, making for a story whose gem-glass plot-points feel jagged, don't quite fit together, rupture your reason-making.  It could make the game an interesting one the second time around, I guess -- that random number generator might dole you out a new snatch of calming Englishman script.  Though I want to consume all the text related to this story, I'm not quite tempted to play it over again, at least not just yet.<br /><br />In conclusion: it's cool that Dear experimental Esther is being received so well!  I'm glad to see people open to the new and unconventional things that video games can express, though there is some argument whether Dear Esther is a Real Game or not.<br /><br />Other articles about Dear Esther to check out: <a href="http://www.blog.radiator.debacle.us/2011/04/ludodiegesis-or-pinchbecks-unified.html">Ludodiegesis, or Pinchbeck's unified field theory of FPS games, or "please pee on my leg and tell me it's raining."</a>, <a href="http://www.brainygamer.com/the_brainy_gamer/2012/02/dear-eisenstein.html">Dear Eisenstein</a>, <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/EMcNeill/20120215/9442/On_Dear_Esther.php">On Dear Esther</a></div>

Documentaries are my whitenoise of choice. Due to studying, I've been listening to a lot more of them on Netflix.

More recently, I've two documentaries about orcas: *Killer Whales* by the Discovery Channel, about the behavior of killer whales in the wild; and *Blackfish*, about orcas held in captivity. They're both pretty incredible; I'm shocked at how much footage there is of killer whales doing things, whether it's hunting poisonous sting rays in New Zealand or yanking human beings into pools by their ankles.

It's pretty hilarious to watch the footage of killer whales hunting seals in the first documentary, with a voiceover of a man marveling at their intelligence; and to watch this footage again in the second, where the background noise is preserved, and a woman is panicking, "Oh no! Oh no! *On noooo*!"

*Blackfish* also connected nicely with the last essay in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Best-American-Science-Nature-Writing/dp/0547350635">The Best American Science and Nature Writing (2011)</a>, though the writer states there that one of the orca trainers was pulled by her hair into the water, whereas trainers in the *Blackfish* movie argue that this is a lie, another way to "blame the victim" of the orca attack, rather than the orca itself and the poor treatment that drove it to "psychopathy."

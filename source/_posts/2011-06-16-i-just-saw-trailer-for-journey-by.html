So Journey presents a very different experience in which you are left kind of powerless against the environment you're presented with."</em></blockquote><br /><br />I haven't felt so much hope and excitement for a game in such a long time, much less wanted to purchase a PS3 just to play something.  I'm so happy that people still make console games that aren't just <a href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/the-6-most-ominous-trends-in-video-games/">army gamez</a>.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-g1t4KGnEj0k/TfpAk-fulHI/AAAAAAAAARI/07_xfbLCW0M/s1600/62660.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-g1t4KGnEj0k/TfpAk-fulHI/AAAAAAAAARI/07_xfbLCW0M/s320/62660.jpg" width="143" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/the-6-most-ominous-trends-in-video-games/">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It occurs to me now that I've always been more of a console gamer, but in the past couple years have played games mostly on the PC, most of them either older releases like Bioshock and Portal, or Flash games.  When I was younger games like Sonic the Hedgehog or Castle of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse were fine, but nowadays I really crave story, for a game to make me think something new.  Games are too expensive to risk going beyond gunsight and realistic blood nowadays, I suppose.</div>

I went with Selesnya because of course. Playstyle-wise (and flavor-wise), I resonate with it more. Plus I love the security of green's fixing.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uBFjufDIWRo/UGj3cpTY-kI/AAAAAAAACkk/CsSHHZ4wVDA/s1600/selesnya.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="556" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uBFjufDIWRo/UGj3cpTY-kI/AAAAAAAACkk/CsSHHZ4wVDA/s640/selesnya.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">for the conclave!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I have to say I <i>really</i>&nbsp;enjoyed the set-up of RTR's pre-release, especially with the boxes and stickers and even a free little spin-down in guild colors (which I unfortunately lost somehow after my last match :( ). Izzet and Golgari were the first sold out at the pre-release that I attended, though I was so sure people would be eating up <a href="http://magiccards.info/query?q=archon+of+the+triumvirate&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname">the Azorius promo</a>. Selesnya and Rakdos were left for last, but after having the opportunity to play against all the guilds, Rakdos really seems to be the strongest in this format, to me, given that it can make use of <a href="http://magiccards.info/query?q=carnival+hellsteed&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname">Carnival Hellsteed</a> right off the bat (attacking as a&nbsp;<i>first strike 6/5 wat</i>), has many not-bad commons, and can even make use of Golgari's scavenge creatures (imagine scavenging counters onto <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=270349">Daggerdrome Imp</a> or something...wah!)<br /><br />My decklist:<br /><br /><i>Creatures</i><br />2x Azorius Arrester<br />2x Centaur's Herald<br />2x Centaur Healer<br />2x Gatecreeper Vine<br />1x Fencing Ace<br />1x Seller of Songbirds<br />1x Rubbleback Rhino<br /><i><br /></i><i>Spells/Artifacts</i><br />1x Street Spasm<br />1x Druid's Deliverance<br />2x Trostani's Judgment<br />1x Eyes in the Skies<br />1x Coursers' Accord<br />1x Call of the Conclave<br />1x Mana Bloom<br />1x Avenging Arrow<br />1x Explosive Impact<br />1x Sundering Growth<br />1x Seek the Horizon<br />1x Collective Blessing (mwahaha)<br />1x Izzet Keyrune<br /><br /><i>Land/Gates</i><br />5x Forest<br />4x Plains<br />1x Mountain<br />2x Selesnya Guildgate<br />2x Transguild Promenade<br />1x Izzet Guildgate<br />1x Grove of the Guardian<br /><i><br /></i>Populate is <i>so fun</i>. Out of all of the pre-release promos, <a href="http://magiccards.info/query?q=grove+of+the+guardian&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname">Grove of the Guardian</a> definitely felt like it was the one with the most synergy with its colors and keywords. The number of times I was able to pop and then populate an 8/8 token and was not insubstantial. And once I managed it, no one was able to bring it/them down, though one Golgari opponent kept fishing for his <a href="http://magiccards.info/query?q=abrupt+decay&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname">Abrupt Decay</a>, in vain. I'm glad that I decided to stick straight with a populate theme, though cracking a <a href="http://magiccards.info/rtr/en/183.html">Niv-Mizzet</a> in my first pack and an <a href="http://magiccards.info/query?q=epic+experiment&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname">Epic Experiment</a> in my second did make it so I was <i>really</i>&nbsp;tempted to splash both red and blue, which I'm glad I didn't.<br /><br />Something I missed was the keywords for RTR playing into some world story. Innistrad's keywords (transforming, morbid, etc.) really spoke to the general atmosphere of the world and its creatures, as well as providing interesting play. I guess the "story" of RTR really may just involve guilds all fighting each other, but it would be nice if there was something a little more than that, which you can soak up without delving into pages of a wiki.<br /><br />I ended up going three and one, and drew a Trostani in one of my reward packs! Constructed Populate deck, here I come~<br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LzGKc_AeqDA/UGj3dMkD5dI/AAAAAAAACks/Nkzs_H9VFx4/s1600/boosters.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="478" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LzGKc_AeqDA/UGj3dMkD5dI/AAAAAAAACks/Nkzs_H9VFx4/s640/boosters.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">wooooo</td></tr></tbody></table><br /></div>

It's now a now-two-issues old literary journal of speculative fiction on UW.  Some of the submissions were really gorgeous, so I was really happy that <a href="http://neauro.com/content/writing/thecrash/writing.php">my (somewhat silly) submission</a> was also featured.<br /><br />I got my issue last night at the release party.  I didn't stay for the sci-fi Jeopardy game afterward (as I never really did get into the Star Wars/Star Trek/Dr. Who nerd-dom), but it was really nice to see that handful of people gather and be so excited about this little quarterly journal.  It's always cool to think that AU was just started up by the whim of three girls.  <span class="shh">If you want something, go get it!</span><br /><br />Haha!  And I just discovered this poem at the end of the issue, which contains the last word of every submission in the journal:<br /><br /><em>Sigh lost angels,<br />rewind the night.<br />Jefferson cares<br />to follow lines of<br />sons.</em></div>

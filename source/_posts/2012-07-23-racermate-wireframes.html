"Wingate Testing with Velotron" -- what does this indicate or mean to a new user? "ErgVideo.com" seems to open a new website completely, how is it affiliated to Racermate, what does it do?<br /><br />For the redesign, I focused on making the site informative to new users.&nbsp;I kept much of the information in the header "The WORLD LEADER in ELECTRONIC BICYCLE ERGOMETERS..." and "OFFICIAL BIKE TRAINERS OF..." -- because they're good explanations of "This is who we are, this is why we are trustworthy."<br /><br />I made the top navigation buttons larger than in the original design, and made them more self-explanatory: "COACHES" in the original turned into "Find a coach;" "MultiRider" became "MultiRider: Ride Together" to give the user more grounding on what they would learn about when clicking through. This would also expand users' knowledge of Racermate products right on the front page; MultiRider can be immediately understood as a social application of a RacerMate product.<br /><br />The next two "rows" of information also serve to focus and explain Racermate through images, rather than text. The first row is a carousel of images, text description, and links to different Racermate products; the next, a much more involved "This is who we are" statement.<br /><br />Because word of mouth is important to this product, part of the front page is also devoted to testimonials sent in by happy consumers.<br /><br /><br /><h2> Product Display Page</h2>Talking with friends at Racermate, I learned that online orders make up a little more than half of the total number of orders that this company gets. But when I went through the website myself, I found the <a href="http://www.computrainer.com/rm_inc/sales/pricing_ordering.html">order page</a> bewildering and cluttered with a variety of colors of clots of text. As a new user unfamiliar with the product, I didn't understand what exactly the product would be when I ordered it, or what would come with it, or what exactly it is meant to do. To get a full picture of what some products do requires that the user navigate to half a dozen completely different pages. Ordering information is also separated from a product overview, and ordering online requires that the user:<br /><br /><ol><li>Learn about the product by navigating around "Products" and all related pages in the top navigation</li><li>Click "Sales" in the top navigation</li><li>Hover over desired product</li><li>Click "Pricing &amp; Information"</li><li>Parse a long order page</li><li>Click "Add to Cart"</li><li>Complete order</li></ol><br />For the redesign, I made the product name and brief description most prominent, and after that, an easy way to switch between views of different product models. Another prominent part of the product display page are images of the product. Features can be described in the text to the right of the product images, or reviewed with more detail further down the page. In the redesign, the steps for ordering online now are:<br /><br /><ol><li>Click "Products" in the top navigation, or hover over "Products" and select desired product</li><li>Learn about product and its models on a single page</li><li>Click "Add to Cart"</li><li>Complete order</li></ol><div><br /></div><br /><h2> What's next?</h2><br />A low-fidelity prototype would ensure that the navigation of the website actually makes sense; users would have to be able to know how to complete certain tasks, such as <i>Find out what exactly you get when you order a CompuTrainer</i>, and with real copy provided, we could ensure that the right kind of information is shown on the right pages. (For example, do people want to know more about certain complex features? Less?) User testing would also target current users who use the website as a hub for Racermate-related news, and ensure that they aren't alienated.</div>

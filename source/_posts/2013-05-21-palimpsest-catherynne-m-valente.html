Valente. Now she weaves a lyrically erotic spell of a place where the grotesque and the beautiful reside and the passport to our most secret fantasies begins with a stranger’s kiss.… <br /><br />Between life and death, dreaming and waking, at the train stop beyond the end of the world is the city of Palimpsest. To get there is a miracle, a mystery, a gift, and a curse—a voyage permitted only to those who’ve always believed there’s another world than the one that meets the eye. Those fated to make the passage are marked forever by a map of that wondrous city tattooed on their flesh after a single orgasmic night. To this kingdom of ghost trains, lion-priests, living kanji, and cream-filled canals come four travelers: Oleg, a New York locksmith; the beekeeper November; Ludovico, a binder of rare books; and a young Japanese woman named Sei. They’ve each lost something important—a wife, a lover, a sister, a direction in life—and what they will find in Palimpsest is more than they could ever imagine.</i></blockquote><br />Being terribly hungry for more of Valente's writing after reading <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2013/05/deathless-catherynne-valente.html"><em>Deathless</em></a>, I chose <em>Palimpsest</em> to read next due to its focus on a city, a subject I have a weakness for ever since reading China Miéville.<br /><br />All I really have to say about this book is <em>wow</em>. My feedback for it is similar to anything I had to babble about <em>Deathless</em> — excellent, poetic, gorgeous. Like <em>Deathless</em>, though the plot was a little flimsy, I didn't mind that much; whereas <em>Deathless</em> was suspended in a fairytale haze that made everything easy to digest, <em>Palimpsest</em> had all the (appropriate) tones of a dreamland, in which things don't make utter sense but are all imbued with truth and urgency.<br /><br />Something else I appreciated about this book in particular was the character Amaya Sei. Though I'm not Japanese myself, I felt that the treatment of Sei as a character was great; she didn't sink into stereotypes, she stood up on her own, and overall she was allowed to be a <em>person</em> rather than a caricature. It was also refreshing to read a story with such a variety of characters, diverse unabashedly and without slowing down to explain things: this person is mixed, this person is gay, and so on.<br /><br /><em>Palimpsest</em> was fantastic.</div>

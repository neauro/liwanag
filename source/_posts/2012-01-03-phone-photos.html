I tend to go on and off with photography in general (though associating my taking pictures with "photography" and its professional air still makes me wince), but I can tie my decrease in photo-taking activity to some specific things this time, namely:<br /><ol><li>The purse that I am currently using for everything, a shoulder-bag Haiku that's lightweight and perfect for notebooks but bulges with a D40 in it;</li><li>My lack of personal computer with which to edit <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/07/raws-vs-jpeg-fine.html">raws</a>&nbsp;<raws>-- my main computer broke after coming back from San Francisco, and I've been subsisting off Andou's desktop and my work computer ever since.</raws></li></ol>As a result, I've been spending most of my time tinkering around with my iPod for photo-taking purposes. The picture quality, compared to my beloved 35mm lens, is obscene, but challenging. How do I get a good picture despite the gross noise and relative inability to get close to a subject?<br /><br />I've been cheating with <a href="http://instagr.am/">Instagram</a><instagram>, which I initially despised as hipster filter city, but now enjoy, mainly because<br /><ol><li>I'm over the arguments of what constitutes "real" photography, and</li><li>"It's just what it is -- pictures from your phone." Nothing more, nothing less. Thus was the revelation of <a href="http://www.nclrmrz.com/">Nicole</a><nicole>, my old roommate.</nicole></li></ol>The filters aren't perfect (who would ever use Kelvin? I mean, really) and the faux tilt-shift filter can also look pretty fauxlty (ohoho). But I like my 24/7 shiba inu photo stream and the silent camaraderie of people liking your photos, somehow more earnest and without the nuance of self-interest on Tumblr. Plus, the constraints are a fun challenge.<div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lHIdZ8TQmJQ/Twe-DQv9bBI/AAAAAAAAAlc/tsmOcA24sGg/s1600/176997d4362711e1a87612313804ec91_7.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lHIdZ8TQmJQ/Twe-DQv9bBI/AAAAAAAAAlc/tsmOcA24sGg/s320/176997d4362711e1a87612313804ec91_7.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">how do i take a picture that will not suck?</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>

This past weekend my boyfriend came down to visit.  After much ado, we managed to obtain a rental car.  Who knew it was so difficult to rent cars when you're younger than 25 and don't have a credit card?  Age and the ability to spend money you don't have presupposes responsibility and maturity, I guess.<br /><br />Though, I'm fine paying an extra $25 for the privilege of being young and having a relatively smaller amount of responsibilities. :D<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/6094860009" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xKo9ES0Oj48/TlxdRywDkRI/AAAAAAAAAYU/NNGXKGmsg7o/s320/tumblr_lqoetldqu21qdycalo2_1280.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">derpaka &amp; shibaru on the dashboard</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The day alternated between fog and sunshine.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GHB28f0mFOo/Tlxc6_pzFtI/AAAAAAAAAYM/dPl25qEsmBc/s1600/tumblr_lqoetldqu21qdycalo1_1280.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GHB28f0mFOo/Tlxc6_pzFtI/AAAAAAAAAYM/dPl25qEsmBc/s320/tumblr_lqoetldqu21qdycalo1_1280.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">starting out</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZF_kNEUyn_M/Tlxd4cVLNXI/AAAAAAAAAYc/oJ7bFzDXmSY/s1600/tumblr_lqoetldqu21qdycalo3_1280.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZF_kNEUyn_M/Tlxd4cVLNXI/AAAAAAAAAYc/oJ7bFzDXmSY/s320/tumblr_lqoetldqu21qdycalo3_1280.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">aaaand some 20 miles later</td></tr></tbody></table><br />What's visible from the highways of California always impresses me on a level that I can't quite explain.  I love how the environment seems to change from mile to mile, how one state can be all at once chilly and arid, all farms and then all dunes, here grass and there <em>ice plants as far as the eye can see</em>.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZqTlDGEd9lA/TlxfktmV6AI/AAAAAAAAAYk/Js-IdlUFJKQ/s1600/tumblr_lqoetldqu21qdycalo6_1280.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZqTlDGEd9lA/TlxfktmV6AI/AAAAAAAAAYk/Js-IdlUFJKQ/s320/tumblr_lqoetldqu21qdycalo6_1280.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">in retrospect, why didn't we stop here?!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Eventually we arrived at destination point #1, my childhood home.  Here is where I had my first cat and my first birds, where I rejected my first Barbie doll and watched things like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kablaam">KaBlam!</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(TV_series)">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> until unreasonable hours of the morning.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DIPkUIL0TTc/TlxgAnRw2QI/AAAAAAAAAYs/gZGIpS2qtAw/s1600/tumblr_lqoetldqu21qdycalo8_1280.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DIPkUIL0TTc/TlxgAnRw2QI/AAAAAAAAAYs/gZGIpS2qtAw/s320/tumblr_lqoetldqu21qdycalo8_1280.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">one of the cars outside this place actually had WA plates</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Then we moved on to our true destination, the Monterey Bay Aquarium.  I wish that I had remembered more of it, or more of the area in general; unfortunately a lot has been lost in time and memory.  The one area that I for sure remembered, the exhibit called <em>Beautiful But Deadly</em> at the top of one of the MBA staircases, was now something else like <em>Enchanted Kelp Forest</em>.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/6095459688/in/photostream" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-txNQrug275k/TlxjbFcRPSI/AAAAAAAAAY0/CbJn-2CFdYQ/s320/6095459688_c62d5422fc.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">spotted jellyfish</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Because a lot of the exhibits were dark, I had a lot of trouble taking pictures of most things, and though I took my telephoto lens I ended up using my 35mm f/1.8 for the majority of the pictures, just so I could grab the light.  In general I had a good time, though the place was swarming with children and parents taking pictures of things, sometimes with a desperateness that was mind-boggling.  Do you really need a photo of your kids at <em>every</em> exhibit?  And sometimes the fervor with which people took photos of exhibits before even taking time to understand or really look at what was going on in them was frustrating.<br /><br />Anyway, this is coming from a person who really only enjoyed the aquarium for all the good <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/sets/72157627426562177/">photo opportunities</a>, so.</div>

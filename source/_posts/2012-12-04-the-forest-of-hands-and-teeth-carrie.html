The Sisterhood always knows best. The Guardians will protect and serve. The Unconsecrated will never relent. And you must always mind the fence that surrounds the village; the fence that protects the village from the Forest of Hands and Teeth. But, slowly, Mary’s truths are failing her. She’s learning things she never wanted to know about the Sisterhood and its secrets, and the Guardians and their power, and about the Unconsecrated and their relentlessness. When the fence is breached and her world is thrown into chaos, she must choose between her village and her future—between the one she loves and the one who loves her. And she must face the truth about the Forest of Hands and Teeth. Could there be life outside a world surrounded in so much death?</em></blockquote><br />I just finished reading The Forest of Hands and Teeth, which was okay. The premise was intriguing and I was looking forward to an engagement with The Whole Zombie Thing that didn't have guns blazing. Overall the book's mood is super introspective, with the protagonist Mary aching for the ocean, the concept of which has been handed down to her from her mother. Eventually, Mary sees the ocean in a photo and can describe it as having "whitecaps" despite possibly never seeing anything with whitecaps before?<br /><br />I wasn't really invested in any of the characters. There are four "main" ones, all of whom are childhood friends: Mary, Cass, and Travis and Harry, who are brothers. Mary and Travis have a mutual love, and Harry loves Mary for some reason and gets betrothed to her, and Cass loves Harry for a reason but is betrothed to Travis, and stays betrothed to Travis even when she falls in love with Harry.<br /><br />"But we can make this work," Mary says when she realizes this, at which point Cass hisses something like, "No! Harry chose you and I want Harry to be happy so I will go with his will! And Travis won't make Harry sad either by taking you away from him, so there!"<br /><br />(Why do they all care about what Harry wants so much? I'm not sure.) <br /><br />The heights of emotional dialogue in the book involve characters getting flustered about whether or not Mary cares about them, and whether or not they are her #1 motivation (which, spoilers, is The Ocean).<br /><br />The book moves fast and feels cramped at times. In two pages Mary and Travis have their first mind-blowing kiss AND marvel in horror at the Fast Zombie Who Wears a Noticeably Red Vest (who I can only ever visualize as a cross between <a href="http://left4dead.wikia.com/wiki/The_Witch">a Witch</a> and <a href="http://gointothestory.blcklst.com/2012/03/great-character-the-little-girl-in-red-schindlers-list.html">that girl from <em>Schindler's List</em></a>).<br /><br />Overall I wish there was more time to get settled into what daily life was like for these characters, surrounded by the undead. Mary spends a lot of time thinking about how awful it is to be surrounded by death but I would have liked to be struck with details about it -- the way as children they might have played chicken out of the reach of desperate, broken fingers -- more about their childhood, actually, would have made them bright and real, more than just a description like "we have always been friends." I would have wanted to see what Harry excelled at if not shooting arrows, why Travis was lured by Mary's stories to also long for Ocean-ness, how Cass's "sunshine" was anything more than her bright hair or a weird smell her flesh gave off.<br /><br />Something else about this book that gave me a niggling feeling was how much time Mary spent bemoaning how bad her life was surrounded by "so much death." The pre-zombie days seem far back away from her time -- so far enough back that I don't quite buy how much she wants them. How can she miss something she never really had? Despite being told a lot about The Good Old Days through various mediums, I personally can't find myself really aching for them, despite the intimidating problems we have now, like horrendous pollution, wealth disparity, Facebook-derived social anxiety, and so on.<br /><br />I still have enough interest in the idea of how hope can perservere in such a world that I'm tempted to pick up the next book.</div>

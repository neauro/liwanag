I think that everyone ended up doing mobile phone applications, including us.  We designed <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/cse440/11sp/projects/kibisis/process.html">Kibisis</a>, which is a mobile payment application.  Its main themes are:<br /><br /><ul><li>Connect your credit cards, debit cards, checking and savings accounts, etc. to one application, so that you can consolidate all your methods of payment</li><li>Keep track of your loans and debts to your friends, useful especially for college students who may split rent or loan money to their friends for dinner</li><li>Transfer your money directly, remotely, and securely from your Kibisis account to the Kibisis account of other people, removing the need to stop by banks to cash checks, or to get exact amounts of cash and then meet up to hand it off</li></ul><br />Listed above (and <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/cse440/11sp/projects/kibisis/process.html">here</a>, again) is the website for our project, which contains all the reports we wrote, which details our testing and design process.  I made the website -- it was a lot of fun.  I really enjoy designing websites, though I concede that I could use more practice and more artsyness.  Probably more practice with Photoshop and Illustrator would help as well.  Every time I try to use Illustrator, I can never figure out how to make even the slightest mark on the canvas.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-X2B2h-qoEoQ/Te_0xOLbovI/AAAAAAAAAQc/WowuNtNZacU/s1600/kibisis_process.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="188" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-X2B2h-qoEoQ/Te_0xOLbovI/AAAAAAAAAQc/WowuNtNZacU/s320/kibisis_process.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">still, i'm really proud of this page somehow</td></tr></tbody></table><br />As we were working on this product, <a href="https://squareup.com/">some other similar</a> ones popped up, which was pretty interesting.<br /><br />Kibisis was the best group project I've ever had. :D And definitely a good way to close out undergrad years!</div>

The popularity&nbsp;of <em>Skyfall</em> didn't mean that <em>Wreck-It&nbsp;</em><em>Ralph</em> had open seats, however, so Andou and I&nbsp;opted to see the still-open 3D movie.<br /><br />[spoilers]<br /><br />It was super beautiful, and all the video game&nbsp;references at the beginning were pretty delightful,&nbsp;yet not, in my opinion, cheesy and overwhelming. It&nbsp;was fun to hear people practically scream at the&nbsp;Metal Gear Solid reference, though my personal&nbsp;favorite was a shot of Sonic blinking and losing his&nbsp;rings after being hit by that spaceship thing :D<br /><br />Overall I was really impressed by the clarity of the&nbsp;story, especially given the risk of confusion&nbsp;resulting from relying on too much video game&nbsp;esoterica or fanservice. Certain words and certain&nbsp;settings threw their weight into the plot's goings-on, and it was nice to feel that the things&nbsp;you saw were, for the most part, not just shiny&nbsp;fluff, but would actually deliver on some interesting and relevant happening.<br /><br />One thing that I just couldn't stand was the&nbsp;character Vanellope.&nbsp;I couldn't muster up sympathy for her at all. @__@  I&nbsp;guess the idea is that her immaturity, selfishness,&nbsp;and spontaneity are okay because she's a child and&nbsp;she has enormous caramel apple-colored eyes? As a&nbsp;character who seems solely there to be "adorable" and&nbsp;act as a motivation for the protagonist, I felt&nbsp;mixed...and had a lot of weird feelings about the&nbsp;character interactions in general.<br /><br />On one hand, it's nice that Ralph finally finds&nbsp;"goodness" not in the accumulation of shiny extrinsic things&nbsp;(like that "Hero" medal), but rather in helping&nbsp;others (specifically, Vanellope). On the other hand,&nbsp;the whole "I'm Ralph and just seeing Vanellope be&nbsp;happy is what I need to be happy :')" had a heteronormative tinge -- <em>Helping children be&nbsp;</em><em>happy is the most important thing in the world!&nbsp;</em>-- and ultimately I feel like I wish Ralph had come&nbsp;to learn more about what he does personally that make&nbsp;him uniquely happy, rather than having his newfound&nbsp;happiness hinge so much on helping a specific person realize their aspirations. I mean, the movie is called <em>Wreck-It <strong>Ralph</strong></em>, right?<br /><br />The inevitable marriage between the only other female main character and the only other male main character was also hugely wince-inducing, just because it seemed so...forced...and inevitable. (Ack! I wince just thinking about it!)<br /><br />Anyway, Vanellope seems unexpectedly popular on Tumblr, so I'm still musing on the reasons why I don't like her. Maybe I missed something...</div>

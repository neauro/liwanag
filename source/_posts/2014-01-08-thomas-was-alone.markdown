*Thomas Was Alone* was super cute, if more ambiguous than I personally like. I liked the personality given to all the different shapes, though their common heroism and conceit got a little old as the game went on, which was why Laura's cynicism made her my favorite (though I felt compelled inexlicably to keep calling her "Ruth"). I loved that the levels were tilted, the play of light, the strange colors. (Though I wonder if any colorblind users had a hard time playing?)

One thing I think the game could have been improved was the game's sense of progression; though numbers ticked up each level, after a while they became meaningless, and now that the game is finished I'm not totally sure what I would use them for. The introduction of each of the colored shapes, Thomas's "death," and the era of the gray shapes seemed to be the largest movements in the story, and though each was accompanied with a fun snippet of "The AIs are gaining sentience!" flavor I didn't really have a sense that things were reaching their end until the end came suddenly to meet me. Some levels seemed like little "drabbles" and experiments, which I completed without much more effort than would take for me to click a cow in Farmville, and it would have been cool to see something else related to AIs breaking their previous ways of being. Breaking through the borders of levels — intentionally disobeying orders — something to add to the flavor text.

I played *Thomas Was Alone* on a projector and if you have the opportunity to do so yourself I recommend it. All those rectangles are like way better when they're as big as your face.

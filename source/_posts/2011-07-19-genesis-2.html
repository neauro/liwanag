It was a pretty interesting ride, around 3 and a half hours by BART and bus from San Francisco to Antioch, though most of it was waiting for the buses on a Sunday, when transportation in general is sparse.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-O4qVxi104B0/TiU5_GGVllI/AAAAAAAAAS8/8cyoXf1Q4D4/s1600/DSC_0158.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-O4qVxi104B0/TiU5_GGVllI/AAAAAAAAAS8/8cyoXf1Q4D4/s640/DSC_0158.JPG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">moar teams</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It's fun to be in a place where people are so passionate about a game that was released <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Brothers_Melee">almost 10 years ago</a>.  I spent the winter of sophomore year rabidly playing this game, trying to perfect my Pikachu and never quite getting the hang of wavedashing.  Andou taught me about all the big names in Smash and I even got to see Axe, who I don't really know or follow but admire because his Pikachu is really good.  I attempted to figure out why, and it seems that fairs and dairs are bad with Pikachu?  Who knew.  They were so satisfying in the first Smash Brothers. :x<br /><br />The only thing that dimmed me a bit is the fact that the group that organizes Genesis is called "DBR," which one of my friends admitted to me stands for "Death By Rape."<br /><br />~___~<br /><br />"They're really nice people," Andou told me, and I'm sure it's true -- the tournament is well-attended and well-beloved, it seems that relatives staffed the counter where they sold food and people were shaken and concerned when it turned out a fellow Smasher had been robbed at gunpoint one night.  It's just sad that a word that stands for so much violence and pain has become so normalized in this community.  Walk by any television and it's a litany of, "<em>SUCK HIS DICK!  YEAH!  HE GOT SO RAPED!</em>"<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tega4Fk7sUs/TiUs6hweEwI/AAAAAAAAASc/QRoM2zZrwnQ/s1600/tumblr_lokfhpSnl81qdycalo1_1280.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tega4Fk7sUs/TiUs6hweEwI/AAAAAAAAASc/QRoM2zZrwnQ/s640/tumblr_lokfhpSnl81qdycalo1_1280.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">when really you were just beaten in a video game<br /><i>by a dr. mario</i>, sure, but still</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Why is there such a close seemingly natural link in this community and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/jul/17/the-rape-of-men">In Real Life</a> between sex and utter pwning of something?<br /><br />I was catching up with a friend and we were discussing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexter_(season_5)">the latest season of Dexter</a>, which involves a particularly hideous plotline involving the torture and murder of several women.  My friend admitted that, despite his general lack of sensitivity to on-screen violence, the repeated rape scenes in Dexter made him squeamish, but when I asked about what he felt about the casual use of "rape" in games he pretty much shrugged it off.  It's normal usage.  It's not really thought of in <em>that way</em>.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-om35AtlMmAY/TiUwzDP4HbI/AAAAAAAAASk/UJwt5liOFzE/s1600/tumblr_lokfhpSnl81qdycalo3_1280.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-om35AtlMmAY/TiUwzDP4HbI/AAAAAAAAASk/UJwt5liOFzE/s640/tumblr_lokfhpSnl81qdycalo3_1280.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">he just got raped, dude.  that's all</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I guess it's nice to be able to just shrug off and trivialize <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2011/jul/15/democratic-congo-male-rape">traumatic injustices</a>.  It pains me that a group filled with genuinely nice people would work under such a name.  <em>Death By Being Physically Violated Until the Last Breath Leaves Your Body.</em><br /><br />I was discussing potential alternatives with Andou and this one is my favorite.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GgGFJxkoyZ0/TiU4uzUm--I/AAAAAAAAASs/CfkYfO5Z6iQ/s1600/dbr.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GgGFJxkoyZ0/TiU4uzUm--I/AAAAAAAAASs/CfkYfO5Z6iQ/s320/dbr.png" width="297" /></a></div></div>

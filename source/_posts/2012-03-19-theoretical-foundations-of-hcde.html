I've been spending the past couple of weeks finishing up winter quarter. &nbsp;I took "Theoretical Foundations of Human-Centered Design and Engineering," in which I broke everything that I had assumed about HCDE's underlying theories, and then reconstructed it again, more tentatively. &nbsp;The essence of the class is this:<br /><br />HCDE is multidisciplinary. &nbsp;HCDE is the swordsman, archer, mage, token female healer, your entire roleplaying party <i>in one subject</i>. &nbsp;As such, the people who develop theories and "rules of thumb" for HCDE all come from varying backgrounds; you can find things relevant to HCDE across a range of journals and conference papers, from cognitive science to sociology to computer science. &nbsp;An advantage of this is the incredible breadth of information that goes into the formulation of this beautiful HCI thingcreature; a disadvantage is that everyone has different ideas of what HCDE should be, and sometimes not a clear idea of where to go <i>next</i>&nbsp;with the study of HCDE, since all our knowledge of it is so spread out. &nbsp;Just imagine what physics would have been like without everyone agreeing on that first instrumental apple-fall, much less talking about it with the same words.<br /><br />We learned about a handful of theories, most of which you can learn about on our group website, <a href="http://neauro.com/hcde501/">HCDE Bistro</a>, which aims to make these potentially&nbsp;mind-boggling&nbsp;theories digestible for the mental palate. &nbsp;In general.<br /><br />In the end, I didn't find myself particularly "aligning" with any theory as the end-all foundational theory for HCDE, but activity theory and semiotic engineering resonated with me in particular. &nbsp;Activity theory runs off the idea that humans have "needs" that they satisfy through interacting with the word (such as a "need" to eat to sustain oneself), and that their activities are performed with <i>intention</i>. &nbsp;Semiotic engineering frames design artifacts as objects of "discourse" through which the designer has a conversation with a user, with the goal being that the user should learn how to perform their tasks more effectively. &nbsp;Semiotic engineering to me sounded quite a bit like game design -- an artifact which is meant to communicate with a user and teach them best practices? &nbsp;Sign me uuup.<br /><br />At the end of the class we were to write a paper, and mine was about what a combined perspective of semiotic engineering and activity theory can help one understand about <strike>players</strike> users learning about how to work with a design beyond "this button does X." &nbsp;It is located <a href="http://neauro.com/hcde501/activityengineering.pdf">here</a>.<br /><br />In conclusion: HCDE has a lot of people asking questions of it. &nbsp;How do I best design for this person, this situation, with this technology? &nbsp;Activity Theory answers, <i>It depends on what the person's intentions are</i>; Distributed Cognition answers that&nbsp;<i>It depends on what other people or objects the person relies on to think and remember things</i>; Semiotic Engineering answers that&nbsp;<i>It depends on what the person learns from the designer's artifact</i>; and so on.<br /><br />HCDE: five hundred ways to say <i>It depends</i>.</div>

<blockquote>At the boundary between this realm and another, there live eight million gods, dead spirits who serve the gods, and other assorted spirits who help and meddle in the affairs of humans. A sweet middle school girl named Mutsumi has been enduring bullying from her classmates, and she goes to the restroom by herself to cry. Scrawled on the bathroom wall is a phone number and the message, "I will solve your troubles."
<br/><br/>

After Mutsumi calls the number, she encounters a homeless, unemployed figure who proclaims himself a "god." Crude, unpredictable, and worthless, he does not answer people's prayers and no one acknowledges him. However, he has one sole power, the ability to cut all who pass between this world and the next.

So <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/search/label/operating%20systems">OS</a> ended, and the world didn't, and I'm taking the games capstone this quarter.  I've wanted to take this class for forever, and finally...!<br /><br />But all the initial excitement was broken by the professor's declaration on the very first day.  "The requirement this quarter is that you all have to make social games."<br /><br />A sudden discomfort in the room.  Social games?  <em>Really?</em><br /><br />We brainstormed hastily, still in shock, and during discussion exchanged mutters.  "I really wanted to make a <em>real</em> game this quarter."<br /><br />Hard to think otherwise then <a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2011/03/the-social-games-rant-you-didnt-hear-from-gdc/">people tend to feel so visceral about social games.</a> <span class="shh">(That link is there more for the comments than the actual article.)</span>  Around the time the Zynga/Hidden Agenda competition started, I started playing FarmVille for t3h research, and I've continued playing it, alongside FrontierVille, though I like the original FV much better -- it lags on my computer less, and I have more Friends who play it, which makes it slightly easier to obtain gifts and stuff.  Plus I guess I'm more into the whole pastoral ideal thing than <strike>manifest destiny</strike> the wild wild west.<br /><br />I've been trying desperately to work out why people hate social games so much and made the mistake of asking my Facebook network about it.  Given the fact that the intersection of Friends who are a) on the Internets and b) video game savvy are also c) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I7xHg7kmr0">intense about Smash</a>, I generally received snark and pointers to <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/33059/Braids_Blow_Social_Games_Are_Not_Very_Social.php">interviews with Jonathan Blow</a>.<br /><br />But, anyway.  I guess the point is that I've been going over it back and forth without much conclusion.   To me, boiled down to their barest bones, FarmVille and WoW (more accepted in that group) are not so much different.  The mechanics encourage you to stick around in exchange for endorphins and the illusion (?) of productivity.  Click something, get something.  Millions of people just float happily in this broth every day.  Why get angry about it?<br /><br />That being said, I was (not completely) swayed to drop the class at the mention of ~*Social Games*~ like a couple other people were, though it would be a lie to say that I wasn't disappointed at all.  It's hard to think of new social games when things like Zynga and Bejeweled Blitz occupy so much of social game mindshare.  But I wracked my brain and when Andreas started talking about a cardgame called Heartbreak (the rules of which I cannot find online right now, as he described them to me) I decided to apply this to a board game and BAM.  GAME IDEA.<br /><br />PRESENTED IMPROMPTU IN FRONT OF THE CLASS THE NEXT DAY.<br /><br />EARNING NO INTERESTED CLASSMATES INITIALLY.<br /><br />THEN, TWO!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Fs5lsvP0CnE/TZ6x_hiv1SI/AAAAAAAAAK8/IWF2FBnShA0/s1600/getacross.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="241" width="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Fs5lsvP0CnE/TZ6x_hiv1SI/AAAAAAAAAK8/IWF2FBnShA0/s320/getacross.jpg" /></a></div><br />We've worked it out a little more and did the presentation pitch and I think we're actually off to a good start.  My half-hearted, half-hated social game idea is now something that I'm pretty excited about!  It's called <strong>Get Across</strong>.  The objective of the game is to get across a board, or "terrain," comprising obstacles such as mountains, monsters, bodies of water.  You can specialize in three classes, and "leveling up" grants you more ability cards.  It's essentially a collaborative online board game.<br /><br />I don't want to get my hopes too high, but it will be a success if I can have my Smash- and HoN-playing friends to play this game and enjoy it, play it and have that sort of heart-racing, "We're working together and beating everything!" feeling at least once. :x</div>

With much help from <a href="http://evolutionlive.blogspot.com/">Alex</a> on the building of our trampoline web mechanic, I think we were able to make a pretty interesting game, one that I think would be fun to take to other places (if I ever find the time, gah).<br /><br />The theme of our game jam was "restraint," which immediately made me think about spiderwebs, and from there me and my teammate came up with a cute story relating to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spider's_Thread">The Spider's Thread</a>, which is an old Japanese short story.  From there I super focused on re-learning <a href="http://flixel.org/">Flixel</a>, and team-mate handled art assets and story, which luckily he was quite enthusiastic about.<br /><br />Flixel has a lot of cool things now, like an interactive debugger which acts as a trace log as well as a running poll for whatever variable you wish, and can also allow you to rewind and pause gameplay.  (To open it, press "~" while your game is running.) Luckily, it is easy to get the hang of, even when trying to remember how to make a FlxRect.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gFziC3DIE1I/TqEAEAHjgcI/AAAAAAAAAeQ/M9JF_rreJMc/s1600/proto4.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gFziC3DIE1I/TqEAEAHjgcI/AAAAAAAAAeQ/M9JF_rreJMc/s320/proto4.png" width="212" /></a></div><br />Alex helped a ton with the web mechanic.  The idea is that the player would be able to draw webs between obstacles in order to propel themselves towards the heavens and nirvana.  However, the web for some reason wouldn't anchor on some of the obstacles, so we secretly made it so that you could draw webs anywhere on the screen, and since we explained the mechanic as "Anchor your webs on obstacles!" no one knew the difference. :D<br /><br />Other interesting design-y things:<br /><ul><li>I initially wanted to make the obstacles randomly generate and fall down, but then we discussed what would happen if blocks fell in an unfortunate pattern that hemmed a player in, so we made the blocks breakable -- hopefully allowing players to have a feeling of happiness when destroying something</li><li>This meant the player would need health to limit from just breaking through everything, and may have to make grueling decisions like "Should I just bust through this obstacle for mad points" or "Should I take the long route to replenish my health with a floating, rotating soda can"</li></ul><br />Hopefully I'll be able to revisit this project again sometime to really polish it up.

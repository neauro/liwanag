Basically I was able to install the Application CD alright, but immediately met upon this ambiguous 9123 error when trying to install a language. &nbsp;(This is on Windows Vista, by the way.)<br /><br />I resigned myself to customer support chat for a couple of hours, and after following instructions, and then fiddling around with their instructions, I finally arrived at a working solution.<br /><br /><ol><li>Install the Application CD. </li><li>Put in the language level CD that you want to install. </li><li>Copy all the files in the language level CD to an empty flash drive.</li><li>Remove the language level CD from the CD drive, but leave the flash drive in.</li><li>At this point I think you could proceed to install a language by clicking <b>Add a Language</b>&nbsp;in Rosetta Stone TOTALe. &nbsp;TOTALe should be able to automatically find the language files in your flash drive.</li><li>For me, just starting to install like this didn't work, so I had to go to <strong>Start</strong> and type in <strong>msconfig</strong> which will bring up <strong>System Configuration</strong>.</li><li>Click <b>Selective startup.</b></li><li>In the <b>Services </b>tab, check <b>Hide all Microsoft services.</b></li><li>Click the button which says <b>Disable all</b>. &nbsp;All the services should now be unchecked.</li><li>Go back through the list of services and find the one called <b>RosettaStoneDaemon</b>&nbsp;and make sure that it <i>is&nbsp;</i>checked. &nbsp;If it isn't, you'll get fatal errors when trying to start up TOTALe again.</li><li>Click <b>Apply </b>and restart your computer. </li><li>Once your computer has loaded in again, start up TOTALe and try<b>&nbsp;Add a Language </b>with the language files on your connected flash drive.</li><li>Rinse and repeat with any other levels that you have.</li></ol><div><br /></div><div>And it works! &nbsp;Actually, I haven't yet finished activating it so I'm not sure if it works completely, but for now at least, it's installed.</div></div>

Thanks so much bud this works great! I already had the RosettaStoneDaemon checked so basically all I had to do was transfer all the language files over to a USB and install them that way. Thanks a bunch!</div>

Hey Emily,<br /><br />Sorry for kind of a late response.  What I did and listed above worked for me.  I had a 4GB flashdrive, but I don&#39;t remember how much space the program actually took up on it.  I&#39;m not a professional and it&#39;s been a while since I did this, but if you have any other questions, let me know. :)</div>

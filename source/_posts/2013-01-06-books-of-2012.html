<div class='post'>
I finished total of 114 books last year. That significantly beats my running average of 15 books per year since 2008 (though I admit I haven't been as avid a user of Goodreads before this year). Before anyone starts getting intimidated, this total is comprised of books of a variety of lengths and content, including: young adult fiction; super grown-up adult fiction; delicious non-fiction probably about the history and political atmosphere surrounding a specific food item; graphic novels and comic books; albums of photography; at least half a dozen light novels; and one James and the Giant Peach.<br /><br />I owe it all to two things:<br /><br /><ol><li>Less school — who knew that only taking evening classes would leave you with so much free time?</li><li>So much commuting — a.k.a. two hours of dedicated reading time every day.</li></ol><br />And so, without further ado:<br /><br /><br /><h2>Memorable Books of 2012</h2><div><br /></div><h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Most Life-Changing</span></h2><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GIPY7HZZT38/UOnwPPIcYbI/AAAAAAAADAw/WjpZWNa_hsY/s1600/Untitled-2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GIPY7HZZT38/UOnwPPIcYbI/AAAAAAAADAw/WjpZWNa_hsY/s1600/Untitled-2.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Wired for Story, </i>Lisa Cron &amp; <i>Reading Like a Writer</i>, Francine Prose<br />(source: Goodreads)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Among all of the non-fiction that I read this year, these two books together were personally the most "life-changing" ones, because before I even finished either of them I felt my entire outlook on reading, writing, and story completely changed. <i>Wired on Story</i>&nbsp;focuses on scientific concepts and general "story architecture," whereas <i>Reading Like a Writer</i>&nbsp;hones in on recognizing and interpreting writing on the "micro" scale, and on holding each word to the light to see its color. Together they were both hugely inspiring and super influential to me, for whom reading and story-thinking takes up a lot of the day.<br /><br /><br /><h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Most Mind-Boggling Concept</span></h2><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-opxuF5ezU7Q/UOnxj01YG2I/AAAAAAAADBo/5vumLb2VAy4/s1600/Untitled-3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-opxuF5ezU7Q/UOnxj01YG2I/AAAAAAAADBo/5vumLb2VAy4/s320/Untitled-3.jpg" width="230" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Sword Art Online: Alicization Running</i>, Reki Kawahara<br />(source: Goodreads)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I read the entire Sword Art Online light novel series as soon as I started getting impatient to see upcoming episodes of the <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/11/sword-art-online-so-pretty.html">anime</a>. They were all fine and didn't quite have the visual appeal or charm of the anime, but I'm singling out the most recent volume because of its completely unexpected <i>what the fuck </i>factor, which involves (spoilers) cloning the "human soul" part of babies' brains, and placing them into a virtual environment to see how they "grow up." Researchers monitor decades and generations of these isolated, disembodied humans in ease, as every year in the virtual environment lasts only a minute in the real world (or something like that). At some point one of the researchers experiments with cloning his own brain into a computer, and when they turn on the speakers, they hear the researcher's voice, aghast and desperate: <i>"What do you mean, </i>I'm <i>the clone? I'm the real one! Let me out of here!"</i><br /><br /><br /><br /><h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Most Shippable</span></h2><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pO9uC-YdoNY/UOn1W3CCEYI/AAAAAAAADDQ/nzo97aMpBSE/s1600/Untitled-4.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pO9uC-YdoNY/UOn1W3CCEYI/AAAAAAAADDQ/nzo97aMpBSE/s400/Untitled-4.jpg" width="276" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Kamisama Hajimemashita, </i>Julietta Suzuki<br />(<a href="http://www.zerochan.net/1222376">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><div><br /></div><div>I started reading this waaay back when it came out and returned to it after its anime series started airing. The anime was surprisingly amusing and charming but the manga is <i>so much better, </i>and Nanami's increasingly time paradox-y story is definitely my defining fangirl obsession for this year, haha.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Most Tears Shed</span></h2></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fR8qnihRLow/UOn2hJdhvbI/AAAAAAAADDc/T6z4psO-lLk/s1600/Untitled-5.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fR8qnihRLow/UOn2hJdhvbI/AAAAAAAADDc/T6z4psO-lLk/s320/Untitled-5.jpg" width="211" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The Fault in Our Stars</i>, John Green<br />(source: Goodreads)</td></tr></tbody></table><div><a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/08/the-fault-in-our-stars-john-green.html">;___;</a></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Most "Shoot, Everything That I Thought I Knew is False"</span></h2><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3TW-PLE_K4E/UOn3PMPqXYI/AAAAAAAADEo/kWTorMqfB6M/s1600/Untitled-6.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3TW-PLE_K4E/UOn3PMPqXYI/AAAAAAAADEo/kWTorMqfB6M/s1600/Untitled-6.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Lies My Teacher Told Me, </i>James Loewen<br />(source: Goodreads)</td></tr></tbody></table><div><br /></div><div>It's hard to describe this book, because I don't think any description could do it justice. It's a book that I think everyone should read if they've ever had to put themselves through high school US history courses. It discusses not just the whitewashing of history, but the strange and problematic air of idolization held for history figures like President Woodrow Wilson, and the politics of textbooks with regards to concepts like classism. It also has a ton of interesting stories about historical people of color. (For example, did you know that there was a Native American named Squanto who was captured by Englishmen, then somehow avoided slavery and made his way to London, then tried to make it back to North America and ended up back in England again, and then finally returned to North America some years later? Whoa!)</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Most "Wow, That was Really Good, I Really Wish There was More"</span></h2><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wNsccR0TXB4/UMzz7Doi4TI/AAAAAAAAC5I/yggPciSAIhw/s1600/9833.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wNsccR0TXB4/UMzz7Doi4TI/AAAAAAAAC5I/yggPciSAIhw/s320/9833.jpg" width="216" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9833.Blind_Willow_Sleeping_Woman">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><div><a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/12/blind-willow-sleeping-woman-haruki.html">As aforementioned</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Most "Wow, I Can't Believe I Enjoyed That"</span></h2><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aitXdecmZAY/UOn6DntXkTI/AAAAAAAADF4/zKLGk1Uw4ds/s1600/East+of+Eden.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aitXdecmZAY/UOn6DntXkTI/AAAAAAAADF4/zKLGk1Uw4ds/s320/East+of+Eden.jpg" width="212" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>East of Eden, </i>John Steinbeck</td></tr></tbody></table><div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">It was really only surprising because I have such a tough time enjoying "classic" literature, but I found myself mesmerized by <i>East of Eden</i>&nbsp;and even stole it from Andou to read desperately while we were waiting to board vacation flights. This book was the first time that I noticed how nuanced and powerful writing could be <i>especially </i>when it is simple and unadorned. To my utter surprise it also featured the coolest Chinese character ever.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">Here's to a brand new year of reading wonderful books :D</span></div></div>

(Actually, there are a couple pictures, but I'm kind of dissatisfied with them, and didn't really have a chance to take pictures of myself...) I did Glaceon and -- oh gosh, I just realized I left my costume at the Convention Center...<br /><br />....<br /><br />...well, it wasn't that hard to make. &gt;____&gt;;; It was basically a light blue kimono and some darker portions made with darker blue, all in this sort of quilt fabric that I found at JoAnn's. (Quilt fabric is always in much more versatile colors...) Since I've made gi/kimono-style clothings at least twice before for Con purposes I pretty much just haphazardly threw it together, yet I feel that it's my most successful cosplay yet.  Probably because I was with all the other Eevees, and I think we made up a pretty impressive gijinka group. :3<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iFSxbqhfPU4/Tbe03Tey_5I/AAAAAAAAAMc/SpjikTGFJEg/s1600/209229_2037154807629_1206997758_2461459_6895401_o.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="480" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iFSxbqhfPU4/Tbe03Tey_5I/AAAAAAAAAMc/SpjikTGFJEg/s640/209229_2037154807629_1206997758_2461459_6895401_o.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">this is kind of an unflattering picture of me, but a good one of everyone else :D</td></tr></tbody></table><br />We had more pro pictures taken by <a href="http://masa-kocha.deviantart.com/">Rachel</a>, an apparently amazing artist and cosplayer from San Francisco who does photography as a hobby.  She's uber busy though, so it will probably take a couple months for us to actually get the pictures that she took of us.  (Apparently she's putting off photo processing until early June!  Just enough time to forget about them and then be happy to see them later. :D) We scrambled over the stone features of the Washington State Convention Center and afterwards shivered in turns as we waited for Eric to finish taking individual shots of all of us.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wKE3LTKlEVU/Tbe1qzPuf4I/AAAAAAAAAMk/fRD8ct7OVFU/s1600/27041_895203577798_10739505_49066831_899936_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wKE3LTKlEVU/Tbe1qzPuf4I/AAAAAAAAAMk/fRD8ct7OVFU/s400/27041_895203577798_10739505_49066831_899936_n.jpg" width="278" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">this is a pic that rachel took of some other of merch staff cosplaying blazblue at last year's con<br />...for the sake of having a picture here</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I was busier at this Con than any other year before, mostly because of commitments as staff, and a lesser willingness to get up early and take advantage of wandering Con in the morning.  FFXIII and Vocaloid cosplays seemed to be especially popular, or at least, that's what I remember the most, aside from the usual smattering of Akatsuki cloaks, and an interesting blend of different video games, including Minecraft, haha.  Also, tons of Hetalia.<br /><br />My favorite thing to do at Con is usually take pictures, but this year I found I wasn't quite so interested in wandering and asking cosplayers for their pictures...maybe because I've become too jaded, or maybe because I'm just tired of the process itself.  For me the joy of Con now comes mostly just from submerging myself in the atmosphere of it -- the excited fanpeoples, the cosplayers who have worked so hard, the shy people who come out all smooth and soft-spoken from their quiet shells from all corners of Seattle and beyond.<br /><br />It used to be that I would also go for all the stuff you could buy, but I guess I've grown out of that too -- just -- can't think of anything to buy.  That being said, I never used to enjoy Artist Alley, but I think I've finally decided that it's another one of my favorite parts of Con -- being there has such a clean, nice, inspiring feeling, unlike being in the general dealer's room.  I bought a beautiful print from Zilva and a poster for Andou from Han Tseng, from <a href="http://directionsofdestiny.com/">Directions of Destiny</a> (which I started reading <em>soooo long ago!</em> Guess it's time to check up on it again).  I actually grabbed the poster on Sunday; I went back home for Easter celebrations and then rushed from the terminal to fifth floor, where I located Han Tseng's booth, already 90% taken down...luckily he was nice enough to pull out a poster for me despite.<br /><br />Also this year at Con, I had my picture taken by a DSi for the first time. I wonder what I would have thought of such a thing back when I started attending in 2006...that handhelds and cellphones have become common cameras is just crazy.<br /><br />So, in summary: Con was great!  Can't wait for the next one. :D</div>

I myself start feeling pretty good about life and chase them around with my camera for a bit, usually to no avail. They're much too shy and quick and the lighting on the building much too florescent.<br /><br />Having now been in offices with dogs wandering about both here and in San Francisco, I'm sold on the both psychological and cuddle-related benefits of furry compatriots.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div></div>

I went to Portland last weekend with Andreas and we visited the <a href="http://japanesegarden.com/">Japanese garden</a>. (I'm still shocked that out of all the Japanese gardens in the world, even the ones in Japan, it's the one in <em>Portland</em> that is japanesegarden.com.)<br /><br />It was quite beautiful.  I had the impression when I entered that it was much larger than Seattle's Japanese garden, but now I'm not quite sure.  Seattle has a wide impressive lake while Portland has waterfalls, and since it's set up at a fairly high altitude, rather than set between the roads crossing through the Arboretum, Portland reminded me more of the gardens that I visited with Derek in Kyoto, especially seeing the high, green, looming cliffs.  Also, just like at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiyomizudera">Kiyomizudera</a>, there's a good view of Portland sprawling out.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/4991486476/in/set-72157624660642459/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LQ5jvg-t7Po/TYv2ZG6FhRI/AAAAAAAAAJs/QKcdwpl-SmU/s320/4991486476_7b85d75ba5_z.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">This is the view from Kiyomizudera; I don't have one from Portland since for some reason for this whole trip I wasn't inspired to take many pictures :/</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I was talking with Heatherchan later, who mentioned that the garden was kind of "underwhelming," and I think when I was there I felt that way too.  <em>We climbed this entire mountain for nothing?</em>  I think on the whole it's because Japanese gardens contain a ton of moss.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/5556088909/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-47108ROc8ao/TYv8dUzdfKI/AAAAAAAAAKc/M8qLk2uWelM/s320/5556088909_170fd3e033_z.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">moss-covered branches</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/5556090059/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Yo2Jlhd0cvc/TYv8drHonUI/AAAAAAAAAKk/Fi80tmuNSPI/s320/5556090059_70224e922f_z.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">mossy tufts</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/5556706640/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DC2L7qDUj0E/TYv8dyUHY3I/AAAAAAAAAKs/FFfuCHrLbiQ/s320/5556706640_fa52e48c34_z.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">mossy rocks</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/5556678042/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-l0bK0ytcsrE/TYv8d0AJ-5I/AAAAAAAAAK0/8VKBGiE7lYE/s320/5556678042_b68d623a32_z.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">just, mossy mcmosserson, everywhere</td></tr></tbody></table><br />When people think of gardens, I'm sure that they think of gardens erupting in splendor, maybe -- as Andreas would put it -- roses and shit everywhere, heavy floral scents, bees.  Grass, at the very least.  In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chado">chado</a> class I took autumn quarter, we spent some time learning about Japanese gardens in relation to tea ceremony and how extraordinary features like beautiful flowers in a path can detract from the solemnity and concentration needed in a ceremony.  Instead of thinking about your guests or your host, about how this moment you're spending with them can never be repeated ever again in the history of the universe, you're thinking, <em>God, look at these roses and shit.</em><br /><br />I imagine that this attitude influences Japanese gardens a lot; that is, if I'm underwhelmed by a Japanese garden, it's probably doing its duty in giving me an opportunity to meditate on my life and my choices so that they'll resonate like stones dropped into a still pool.<br /><br /><span class="shh">etc. etc.</span><br /><br />A lot of Portland Japanese Garden was under construction, too, so I can imagine that if it lacked a little majesty, it will probably acquire it later.<br /><br />There was a stone garden by a Japanese-style house that was under construction, and since we climbed for forever to reach the garden, Andreas and I sat down and I proceeded to take tons of pictures, with the (vague) intent to create a panorama.  Andreas insisted that I stitch it together by hand, but since programs are written to save time and because they want to be used, I just Googled panorama stitching and downloaded the first program I found, called <a href="http://hugin.sourceforge.net/">Hugin</a>.<br /><br />It's pretty easy to use.  You just dump all your pictures in there, put in your camera data (if it's already not interpreted for you), and then say, "Go, program!  Align!"<br /><br />Disclaimer: I read no instructions and knew absolutely nothing about this software or panorama-stitching softwares at all, so I was just kind of experimenting and seeing what would happen.  At some point the program said that it couldn't find coordinations between two groups of photos, and asked for control points, which I kind of assumed (with my quarter's knowledge of computer vision) that it wanted me to tell it what points in two different pictures corresponded to the same object in both.  This was easy and kind of fun to do.<br /><br />This was my first result:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qnc33xmH_eA/TYv4BOKTpBI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/9hnNzARl47s/s1600/portlandjg_pano_orig.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="209" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qnc33xmH_eA/TYv4BOKTpBI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/9hnNzARl47s/s320/portlandjg_pano_orig.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">oh my goodness why what happened</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I was kind of disappointed because I thought that everything would just look perfect off the bat (.___. The weird mossy spot to the right was obviously wrong, and there are rocks off to the right that are weird too.<br /><br />But then I thought, <em>Wait.  What if I add more control points?</em><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AF5eEECpYwg/TYv4iRS2_-I/AAAAAAAAAJ8/0buYTC_U5cg/s1600/portlandjg_pano_v2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="175" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AF5eEECpYwg/TYv4iRS2_-I/AAAAAAAAAJ8/0buYTC_U5cg/s320/portlandjg_pano_v2.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">what! &nbsp;it kind of worked!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It is super fun to add more control points.  I also like how the program shows you the strength of the match in the control points between two different pictures.<br /><br />There was still the obvious mess of the railing below though, probably because it lacks features, to the extent that it's kind of difficult for even me to make control points. :/<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2qcePuU2W0s/TYv5IsK4f9I/AAAAAAAAAKE/dUBMC-Dzfu4/s1600/portlandjg_pano_v3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="237" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2qcePuU2W0s/TYv5IsK4f9I/AAAAAAAAAKE/dUBMC-Dzfu4/s320/portlandjg_pano_v3.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">we're getting there, though</td></tr></tbody></table><br />And, finally:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n8xPQhr3pGE/TYv53-ygKbI/AAAAAAAAAKM/6PFi9yF-5uE/s1600/portlandjg_pano.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="351" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n8xPQhr3pGE/TYv53-ygKbI/AAAAAAAAAKM/6PFi9yF-5uE/s400/portlandjg_pano.png" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">still a couple weird spots, but good for a first try when i don't really know what i'm doing</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Mental notes for making panoramas in the future:<br /><ul><li>Don't give up after the program's first attempt at stitching; find places that are weirded out and add more control points around that region.</li><li>If something is fairly long and texturally featureless (i.e. a pole) maybe try placing a hand on it or some other marking, to give the program an easier time at aligning.</li><li>Make sure to get pictures at the border of the wanted panorama!  I ended up with a lot of holes which prevented me from getting a good rectangle 3:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xjqqVBKW1y0/TYv6GMDroOI/AAAAAAAAAKU/SqPSKeiB8WY/s1600/panoooooooorama.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="226" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xjqqVBKW1y0/TYv6GMDroOI/AAAAAAAAAKU/SqPSKeiB8WY/s320/panoooooooorama.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">YOU RUINED EVERYTHING</td></tr></tbody></table><br /></li><li>I should probably also try standing up and walking around next time when taking pictures to avoid the fisheye effect;; Not that it's entirely ugly.</li></ul></div>

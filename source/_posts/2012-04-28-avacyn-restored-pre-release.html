My MTG clique decided to go to Green Lake Games at midnight for the AVR pre-release. &nbsp;Woo!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VPwktK5GrF4/T5ypAK3OhNI/AAAAAAAAAy4/dm6wMifIcsY/s1600/Archwing-Dragon.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VPwktK5GrF4/T5ypAK3OhNI/AAAAAAAAAy4/dm6wMifIcsY/s320/Archwing-Dragon.jpg" width="229" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="http://www.gatheringmagic.com/richcastle-04192012-avacyn-restored-preview-archwing-dragon/">source</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I opened packs and was like, <i>Okay, okay, red looks good...oh, here's a Wolfir Silverheart (holographic!)...oh, Entreat the Angels, guess I'm also going white. &nbsp;</i>Sometimes I feel like&nbsp;Naya colors (red, green, and white) <i>call to my soul (</i>in the same way that Andou says white weenie is just "so <i>me"</i>), but I guess it doesn't hurt that red/green together have AVR's removal and bombs/fatties/enormous high-powered things. &nbsp;In the end I went 3 and 1, crumpling at the end to another red/green player whose deck was <i>way</i>&nbsp;faster than mine, and had much better fat unblockable green support.<br /><br />Final decklist:<br /><i>Creatures</i><br />1x Angelic Wall<br />1x Nightshade Peddler<br />1x Kruin Striker<br />1x Falkenrath Exterminator<br />1x Hanweir Lancer<br />1x Fervent Cathar<br />1x Riot Ringleader<br />1x Mad Prophet<br />1x Goldnight Commander<br />1x Archwing Dragon<br />1x Wolfir Silverheart<br />1x Zealous Conscripts<br />1x Archangel<br /><br /><i>Spells</i><br />1x Pillar of Flame<br />1x Blessings of Nature<br />1x Thunderous Wrath<br />2x Cloudshift <br />1x Defang<br />1x Thunderbolt<br />1x Entreat the Angels<br />1x Cathar's Crusade<br /><br /><i>Lands</i><br />7x Mountain<br />6x Plains<br />6x Forest<br /><br />Notes:<br /><ul><li>After writing this list I wondered whether I should have just gone out full red/white (I guess I only had 3 green cards?!), but I did have a fun game with <b>Wolfir Silverheart</b>&nbsp;bonding with <b>Kruin Striker</b>&nbsp;for 8 points of trample damage...which definitely isn't something that would have happened without green!</li><li><b>Archwing Dragon</b> is SO GOOD. &nbsp;The 4 mana cost turned out to be pretty "fast" against this set, where a lot of the heavier flyers were 7-mana angels. &nbsp;Other flyers (like that Scrapskin Drake) can't beat it, and the fact that it zips back into your hand at the end of every turn isn't too bad/is pretty good, since it avoids things like Terminus.</li><li>Plus, it works so well with <b>Goldnight Commander</b>&nbsp;(the thing that says "Whenever another creature enters the battlefield under your control, creatures you control get +1/+1 until end of turn"). &nbsp;A 5/5 swinging at your face? &nbsp;Okay! :D</li><li>Or maybe it's even a 6/6 because you <b>Cloudshift</b>ed something else that was already on the field, as I did in one match when I also had an Archangel out. &nbsp;Archwing as a 5/5 plus Archangel as a 7/7 with Vigilance? &nbsp;Wooww</li><li><b>Cathar's Crusade</b>&nbsp;("Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, put a +1/+1 counter on each creature you control") looked <i>really</i>&nbsp;fun, but in the end I could only shoot it off once, and aside from buffing Archwing Dragon slightly it didn't really do much. &nbsp;At other times I really just needed other things, like creatures.</li><li><b>Entreat the Angels</b>: this last-minute unexpected "Miracle" thing sometimes feels like cheating, especially that one time when I can shot off 3 4/4 fliers for 5 mana</li><li><b>Angelic Wall</b>: useless against the huge variety of green things that shut blockers down, like Champion of Lambholt or even Wandering Wolf (which is <i>really</i>&nbsp;easy in green to buff up to a 6/6 that's unblockable and also avoids burn removal, ack).</li><li>At some point I had a <b>Raging Poltergeist </b>but it's so disappointing to have to trade with Human tokens :( At some point I gave him First Strike with a Hanweir Lancer, but then the other guy gave his own guys First Strike, so, meh.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>I really wanted to play with flicker effects for the pre-release, but just didn't get the right pool for it. &nbsp;Maybe I'll get to during the actual release.</div></div>

It's the sort of thing that a girl like me hears and thinks, <em>This game was not made with me in mind.  Not sure I'm really feeling this one.</em><br /><br />But the trailer absolutely hooked me, precisely at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZAuKkv4eZE&feature=youtu.be&t=2m33s">this part.</a><br /><br /><em>Wait.  Wait.  There's a STORY.</em><br /><br />I finished it over the course of two days, though admittedly I didn't farm as much as I could have; I focused my attentions on the War Machete and Scrap Musket, and then later, the Galleon Mortar, which is awesome because it can <em>go over walls</em>.  Besides the gorgeous graphics, voice acting, and storytelling, I realized that what makes Bastion super special is its logistical gameplay, which I learned about recently from <a href="http://evolutionlive.blogspot.com/2010/03/flydrill-and-logistical-gameplay.html">Alex</a>.<br /><br /><blockquote><strong>Logistical gameplay</strong> revolves around choosing how to allocate your resources - which upgrades to invest in, how much to spend, how much to save, and how to manage your time and effort effectively for the greatest payoff. The pleasure of Logistical gameplay is not in simply doing something, but in doing it well - optimizing it to perfection. This is why achievements are so important. They give the player a reason to excel.</blockquote><br />Logistical gameplay, according to <em>21st Century Game Design</em>, is preferred by 50% of the US population (pg. 910), which makes it special and important.  (Though this same book has statements like "Often, little thought is given to players who are trying to play [a] game for short, intermittent periods of time," which is something that definitely gets more attention now thanks to Facebook and smartphone games.)<br /><br />So why is Bastion so logistical?<br /><br /><h3>There are a variety of ways to pair your weapons (and magic spell thing),</h3>all of which lead you to interact with the game world in different ways.  I am a sucker for fast, DPS-y weapons, so as soon as I discovered the War Machete I stuck with it all the way, but Andou apparently farmed the heck out of this game and discovered things like if you pair the Fang Repeater and Dual Pistols, you can shoot fast by alternating shots, and when reloading one gun you end up reloading both.  Wat!<br /><br />Passive abilities obtained by equipping distillery drinks also increases the amount that you can optimize your strategies and play.<br /><br /><h3>There are a variety of ways to upgrade each weapon;</h3>for example, you can choose to make War Machete have intense critical hit damage, give it the ability to poison enemies to kill them over time, or double up on the damage it could make if thrown as a range weapon.  With the Scrap Musket, you could choose to increase its dealt damage or else its spread or throwback.  So, the same two weapons can now be used in a variety of strategies --<br /><ul><li>Musket to throw back enemies, then throw Machete to poison and eliminate at a distance</li><li>use Machete to deal a lot of damage to enemies in a close area, then use Musket to finish up</li><li>use Machete to poison a ton of enemies in a close area, then use Musket to throw them back</li><li>etc.</li></ul><br /><h3>Upgrading your weapons to the max doesn't mean that you'll be too over-powered to play the game</h3>because in Bastion you can use the idols of gods to make your enemies more resilient.  Hense (Goddess of Pain and Pleasure) will make enemies more aggressive in general, whereas Yudrig (God of Impulse and Bravery) make enemies cause damage on contact; other idols can make enemies drop live grenades when killed, or else make them <em>never</em> drop anything (including potions to replenish life and magic)...<br /><br />I remember really liking this balancing mechanism in <em>The World Ends With You</em> as well; even if you farm out all the enemies in the area, you could go into the menu and increase the enemies' strength for bigger payout in experience, money, and items.  But, bonus points to Bastion for making all the idols interesting to discover and see, and making them (and all the weapons, actually) relevant to the story as well.  Plus, since you can actually control the ways in which enemies become more powerful, you can change The Kid's equipment and passive abilities up to optimally address whatever constraints you decided to invoke.<br /><br />So, hurray for Bastion: a happy, focused marriage of strong gameplay and storytelling.</div>

Yay, you wrote a blog post kind of about something I told you about! Cool! :D<br /><br />It&#39;s funny, reading all these details about the weapon system in Bastion makes me realize that I&#39;ve *never* played a game that involves logistical gameplay to this extent. At least, outside of strategy games, which is a different sort of thing. I&#39;ve never played a game where I was really using logistical skills or choices in weapons and items I used. Actually, looking at all the types, whether tactical or strategic or diplomatic or whatever, it&#39;s amazing how little I understand in terms of concrete specifics. My understanding is so vague and academic, it&#39;s funny. :p<br /><br />PS - there&#39;s a typo in the title! Log(t)istical?</div>

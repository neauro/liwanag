But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone - tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness. The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth...and any chance for rescue. As fear turns to panic, every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left. But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.</blockquote><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1">I saw <i>Gravity </i>with A last week. It was alright. People warn that the movie will cultivate in you a brand-new fear of nothingness but I have to say that what terrified me the most was the crescendo of the soundtrack, thickening and filling me with anxiousness before anything had even happened. The death of Goerge Clooney's Matt also seemed to me to be unreasonably tragic, especially given the fact that he could have been <a href="https://twitter.com/neiltyson/status/386990527406563329">easily rescued</a>.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">I would have liked Matt's sacrifice to be foreshadowed more clearly; the reasons for his final no-nonsense altruism were unclear. Did he sacrifice himself out of a sense of duty? Out of logic? Out of love for Ryan? The story poses life as utterly valuable — worth proceeding with, despite internal struggles and pain — yet allows Matt to give up his existence so easily. I don't understand how he came to decide Ryan's life was valuable. I don't even understand how Ryan herself decided this about her own life at the end, laughing and monologuing and screaming as she fell back to the earth.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">I'm biased, maybe — why someone would want to cling to life in the immensity of space is something I was anticipating this movie would explore. Since my personal contemplation of space eventually lends itself to existential panic and dismay that my life is so small compared to a millennia of life and death and nothingness,&nbsp;I wanted to see how this movie would handle it, to see how many mad hyperventilating spirals it would take to get down to hell and come out the other side. I wanted to know what it was people were really missing out there in space, and what was it that kept pulling them back to Earth.</div><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1">(....eh? <i>Ehhhh?</i>)</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2">On a completely different note, the morning before I watched <i>Gravity </i>was the morning I started reading about the Kessler syndrome in <i>Best American Nature and Science Writing 2011</i>…what a weirdly exciting coincidence. I wanted to stand up in the theater. "Guys! GUYS...IT'S THE KESSLER SYNDROME!"</div></div>

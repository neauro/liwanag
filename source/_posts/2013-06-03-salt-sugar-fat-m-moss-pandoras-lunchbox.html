Suffice to say that processed foods are achieved through an incredible amount of user testing and design, the results of which understands so deeply the heart and chemical of human desire that game designs would probably blush if they could.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">For example, did you know that Doritos can be made without the powder coating your fingers, and taste exactly the same â€” but that the manufacturers keep Doritos with the powder because they view it as part of the "experience" of eating Doritos? I am skeptical, but impressed by the idea.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Both books touch on how processed food conquered kitchens under the weakened defenses of working, busy parents. <i>Salt Sugar Fat </i>was an in-depth view on these ingredients and their uses through the industry; <i>Pandora's Lunchbox </i>touched on these as well, but also explored trends like the use of soybeans in Everything, and research on the benefits of whole foods versus processed foods.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">For example, did you know that a Japanese study fed two groups of rats food that was nutritionally identical, but one group got "normal" hard pellets and one received "puffed" pellets (like puffed cereal)? The rats that received "puffed" pellets ended up gaining a significant amount of weight over the other rats! Potentially because food calories are partially used in actually breaking down that food, and foods that are processed take up less calories to break down, in addition to allowing sugars and starches to enter the bloodstream more quickly than the body may be able to handle.</div><br /><div class="p1">Rather than being wholly disgusted by processed foods, I find myself weirdly more interested and fascinated by them and the fact that their taste and texture has been so incredibly optimized for my body.<br /><br />I'm also way more enthusiastic for farmer's markets than I was before. To prove it, here's a photo of my new arpakasso with some potatoes I obtained last Saturday!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/auroraki/8918019794/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sXthaSc3jMg/Ua1iAUW4gPI/AAAAAAAADrk/hmqw405b354/s640/tumblr_mnqmyiw6Dz1qdycalo4_500.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i named him "babbu"</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I recommend both books to people who have an interest in food as well as an interest in what can make humans enjoy things perhaps more than they should.</div></div>

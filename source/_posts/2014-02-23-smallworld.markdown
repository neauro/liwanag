Last Friday we hit up a small pub table and inconspicuously played J's copy of Small World, <a href="http://www.daysofwonder.com/smallworld/en/">"the fun, zany, light-hearted civilization board game!"</a>

<blockquote>Designed by Philippe Keyaerts as a fantasy follow-up to his award-winning Vinci™, Small World is inhabited by a zany cast of characters such as dwarves, wizards, amazons, giants, orcs and even humans; who use their troops to occupy territory and conquer adjacent lands in order to push the other races off the face of the earth. (<a href="http://www.daysofwonder.com/smallworld/en/">via</a>)</blockquote>

This game has some disturbing colonialization themes aside; there are even pre-existing people in some territorites that you must conquer to inhabit that territory. Even so, I enjoyed this game so much that I eyed it hungrily at Card Kingdom after our party dispersed. The delicious flavor! The cool (albeit almost entirely white) characters! I love that the game naturally becomes different each time as you mix "race powers" and "special powers;" I love that the flavor of the game itself, its pictures and words, are delicious and meaningful and fly off the cardboard and became us — as in the terrifying era of K's Pillaging Skeletons, uprooting their femurs from mountain and farmland and laying waste across nests of Flying Trolls and Berserk Humans, resting for only a moment before rising again in greater number. *What*.

One weak part of the game, however, are the victory points. They are called gold; if you have the most of them at the end of the game, You Win. Flavor-wise, I don't feel like they entirely fit — when, during all this conquest, does gold arbitrary rise from the depths? — and there's also not much that you can do with them, other than occasionally exchange them to get the race you want. During the "conquest" phase, they are useless. What if instead you could use them to do something like increase your number of troops, and gamble to try and get more land? What if you needed to pay coins in order to roll for reinforcement, an action that is otherwise totally free and something you usually want to do? It seems like a missed opportunity for <a href="http://evolutionlive.blogspot.com/2010/03/flydrill-and-logistical-gameplay.html">logistical gameplay</a>, and allowing players the pleasure of "not simply doing something, but doing it well — optimizing it to perfection."

A also noted that, though he felt he had made the right "decisions," he still placed last in our group of four, and didn't grasp how he could have played the game better. He didn't feel that he had "gained experience" and learned how to play the game any better. Though I can't find it now, it reminds me of what I have read once regarding <a href="http://spryfox.com/our-games/tripletown/">Triple Town</a>, and how it seems to be a simple game until you make a mistake — *and then you get it*, you get what the game is about, you feel excited to give it another go.

I hope to try out the expansions sometime, though the use of "gypsy" as a race in one of them is disconcerting, and reminds me of how uncomfortable the overall theme is.

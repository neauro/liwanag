After NaNoWriMo finished, my pastime of choice during my commute became playing through *Phoenix Wright: Dual Destinies*.

[ spoilers ahead ]

Athena was a cool protagonist, though scenes where she was relegated to "cyncial dude's naive, enthusiastic female sidekick" were yawny. (Come on! Maya and Trucy are already these characters, we don't need more of them.) Ultimately it's nice to see that Athena has her own reasons for entering the attourneyforce, and though they were man-centered they were also totally platonic, which was nice. Athena's devoting to "saving" Blackquill also mirrored her desire to save her best friend, Juniper Woods, which meant her dramatic, heroic tendencies at least were in character.

Mostly I was happy to see old characters again, even Apollo Justice, who I disliked before but liked in *Dual Destinies*, probably because he was now a familiar face, haha. What I wanted most out of this game was to see Maya again, but I guess a note from her will do in lieu of *nothing*.

I also liked *Dual Destinies*' execution of "telling the end at the beginning." One of my favorite parts was realizing that Apollo had had an eyepatch over his eye even *before the courtroom explosion* â€” it was a fun/cute manipulation of the audience's assumptions that that particular bandage was just part of his injuries.

Good examples of "the end at the beginning" does *not*, however, include all the times that the game felt obliged to either tell you who the antagonist was, or make it clearly obvious, and PWDD's "<a href="http://www.awkwardzombie.com/index.php?page=0&comic=123013">serious case of the hand-holdies</a>" led to me to really only loving the game's final case, and feeling shruggy about the others. It would have been nice if each case had contributed more to each character's development as well; "Ninetails Vale" in particular didn't feel tied to anything in the larger story, and as a standalone wasn't terribly interesting to me either.

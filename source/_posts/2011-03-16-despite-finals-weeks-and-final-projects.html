It took a couple months for it to arrive, but once it did, I opened it <em>and didn't close it until I was done</em> (pretty much).<br /><br />What the heck?!  Katniss seemed at first to be almost a Bella-type character -- a little snarky, a little spiteful of the people around her, such as her mother -- but unlike empty, hate-for-nothing Bella, she had reasons and whys.  And at first I thought that The Hunger Games would be nothing new -- maybe something like Battle Royale and The Running Man put together -- but somehow -- it was just <em>perfect</em>.  A suspenseful story, full-fleshed characters with a lot to fight for, <br /><br />Luckily the next two books came in more promptly (maybe because everyone always wants to read the first book?) and I finished the second at 4:30am, and the third at the following 2:30am, and then just lied there in bed, exhausted.  It's so rare that you just find books <em>this good</em>.  So rare that there's a YA book about war that I feel treats it with the gravity and heartbreak that I feel war deserves -- makes you feel the pain of people you love dying, for no reason, just so that one person can be in power and not another.  And the pain that the characters went through felt so <em>powerful</em>...<br /><br />You really should just read it yourself o___o There's only a couple books in this world like these ones.<br /><br />After reading it, I felt more inspired to write the story that I've been working on since forever, to <em>really</em> write it, to make it this good.  But, I feel so in awe.  How could I possibly ever be this good?  How would I be able to put believably put my characters through this much, believably have them get themselves out of it?</div>

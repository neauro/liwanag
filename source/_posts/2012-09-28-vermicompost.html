<div class='post'>
Ever since Leilani told me about them, I've been absolutely obsessed with doing <em>vermicompost</em>, aka getting a box, filling it with worms, and leaving my organic materials in there to rot and be eaten and transformed into ~*castings*~ after about six months.<br /><br />Step 1: Get the box. In this case, two Rubbermaid boxes into which were easily drilled rows and columns of holes. The holey one is meant for the worms; the one without the holes is meant to gather what I believe some people refer to as "worm tea."<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9kSBfcX8CpE/UGaJA8WN0hI/AAAAAAAACjM/vQv6hzFzpR0/s1600/DSC_0001.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9kSBfcX8CpE/UGaJA8WN0hI/AAAAAAAACjM/vQv6hzFzpR0/s400/DSC_0001.jpg" width="265" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">break out that drill</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Step 2: Get and prepare the&nbsp;bedding&nbsp; Actually, I got the worms first before preparing the&nbsp;bedding&nbsp; which consisted of an issue of Real Change and some pages from The Stranger (torn haphazardly into one-inch, stripper-ad-covered strips), and a bunch of old peanut shells and bok choy ends from that night's <a href="http://rasamalaysia.com/recipe-kung-pao-chicken/2/">dinner</a>. Because worms thrive in a wet environment, you're supposed to <a href="http://organicgardening.about.com/od/compost/ss/setupawormbin_4.htm">soak the papers until they feel like a damp sponge</a>.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7YUalRY0ACc/UGaJCEJFC9I/AAAAAAAACjk/qiCVGrlvrXg/s1600/worms.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7YUalRY0ACc/UGaJCEJFC9I/AAAAAAAACjk/qiCVGrlvrXg/s640/worms.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">worms and bedding</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Step 3: Once the beddings are prepared, put in the worms! We got these worms from <a href="http://www.stonewayhardware.com/">Stoneway Hardware</a>, which seemed to be one of the few places in Seattle that have them in supply. At first glance the canister seemed full of dirt, but after curiously (and then furiously) drumming out the clump of soil from the bottom of the canister, we stared in shock and not a little abrupt nausea at the wriggly, thrashing mass.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-q4-AEPVyFg4/UGaJBkon9OI/AAAAAAAACjc/Cc0qV_eLn4E/s1600/wormbin.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="396" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-q4-AEPVyFg4/UGaJBkon9OI/AAAAAAAACjc/Cc0qV_eLn4E/s640/wormbin.jpg" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">worms!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />They thrashed away from the light, some of them so vehemently that they fell down the drill holes and had to be rescued and placed back amidst the feast. We then covered the tub with a thin layer of <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/09/autumn-perennial-planting.html">compost</a> (having heard that compost can be full of helpful microbes) and placed it lovingly inside an empty cabinet for easy disposal of plant-based debris.<br /><br />It's hard to say what really attracted me to vermicompost, but I guess it's the idea that you're <em>closing the circle</em> -- putting some of your food to the creatures who will help you convert it into stuff to help more plant foods grow. I guess it doesn't hurt that I really enjoy taking care of things in general, especially when "taking care of things" consists of placing a bok choy end in a cabinet every now and then.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CExg13WO2sg/UGaJBJdqisI/AAAAAAAACjU/31e28x48Grw/s1600/cabinet.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CExg13WO2sg/UGaJBJdqisI/AAAAAAAACjU/31e28x48Grw/s400/cabinet.jpg" width="265" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">thar be worms</td></tr></tbody></table></div>

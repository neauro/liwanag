I've never read Murakami's short stories before, but enjoyed these ones, mostly because reading novels by Murakami for me is like falling into a dark, magical pit, and upon landing at the bottom you are left winded, stranded, and a little bit at loss but convinced that you saw sparkling things on the way down so it was all pretty cool overall.<br /><br />In contrast, reading each short story here was like eating green tea pudding. Your mouth, meeting the first bite, finds it bitter and creamy and bewildering; meeting the second, acclimates, and thinks, <i>Oh wow, okay, whoa, this is great</i>; and then you're opening your mouth for the next mouthful and there's nothing but spoon.<br /><br /><i>Wait! But -- what --?</i><br /><i><br /></i>I have no idea. But those first two bites were pretty good.</div>

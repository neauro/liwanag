In contrast, a saturated fat has its connections rounded out by hydrogens and has a tight crystal structure which is less prone to oxygen invasion. &nbsp;For this reason, some foods' fats are subjected to a process which forces hydrogen into the molecules, so that it has longer shelf life. &nbsp;But this means the food gains what is called <i>hydrogenated fat </i>or <i>trans fat</i>, and if there's any health professional in the world that says that this is safe for you to put in your body in any quantity, it's not written in this book.</li><li>The modern-day "extra virgin olive oil" should indicate that the oil has been created by olives that have yielded their juice through a centrifuge, and not undergone any refining treatment (which can involve deodorizing or bleaching). &nbsp;The term "extra virgin olive oil" doesn't mean a lot, however, since the majority of olive oil sold by companies is labeled "extra virgin," and may still be partially refined or cut with other vegetable or seed oils.</li></ol><div>After reading this book I wanted desperately to try a Real Olive Oil, but the book mostly recommends audiences to go straight to the mills and purchase there, and no amount of googling for Real Olive Oils accessible in the Pacific Northwest could refute this. &nbsp;Maybe I'll be able to try one out next time I'm in California.</div></div>

Now that it's summer and I've come to rely more on my Orca Card instead of my beloved (yet inactive) student bus pass, a couple things become apparent:<br /><br /><ol><li><b>I really wish I knew when my transfers ended. </b>I don't even remember how long transfers are supposed to last. Two hours? Three? When you pay in cash, the bus driver hands you a little piece of paper which can be used as fare for your next bus ride, as long as you're fairly within time limits. With Orca, your transfer is invisible, and strict -- are you leaving the bus two minutes after your fare is up, because of traffic or because the bus itself is late? Too bad, you're paying the fare again. (This also gets frustrating when you board a bus that's "Pay as you leave" -- because even if you got on the bus within the time limit, what if you disembark too late?)</li><li><b>I really wish I knew how much money I had on my card as soon as I looked at it. </b>In my mind I imagine a little E-ink box that would happily display your available funds, in a futuristic, perfect society. To be fair, the card reader does tell you what your card's remaining balance is once you swipe, but I find myself squinting at the small, gray-on-gray display every time I pass by. And, it would also be nice if this card reader could tell you things like, "Hey, your transfer will be up at 4:15pm!"</li></ol><div><br /></div><div>Not knowing when your transfers end can also be problematic for low-income users; as a professor in the HCDE department at UW <a href="http://bethkolko.wordpress.com/2011/04/16/how-technology-encodes-values/">points out</a>&nbsp;from a student dissertation, "Basically, you board the bus and swipe your card. If you’re inside the allotted transit time, nothing is deducted from your card. If not, the full fare comes off your card. And for some people, that might have been their way to work tomorrow. And that’s it for their cash this week."</div></div>

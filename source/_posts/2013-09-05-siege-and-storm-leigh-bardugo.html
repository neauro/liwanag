But she can't outrun her past or her destiny for long.<br /><br />The Darkling has emerged from the Shadow Fold with a terrifying new power and a dangerous plan that will test the very boundaries of the natural world. With the help of a notorious privateer, Alina returns to the country she abandoned, determined to fight the forces gathering against Ravka. But as her power grows, Alina slips deeper into the Darkling's game of forbidden magic, and farther away from Mal. Somehow, she will have to choose between her country, her power, and the love she always thought would guide her--or risk losing everything to the oncoming storm.</em></blockquote><br /><div class="p1"><i>Siege and Storm </i>is the second book in The Grisha Trilogy, and I picked it up because <i><a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/12/shadow-and-bone-leigh-bardugo.html">Shadow and Bone</a> </i>was alright, and I like finishing what I start. <i>Siege, </i>unfortunately, felt much messier than <i>Shadow — </i>details and characters were everywhere — they didn't seem to stick to their identities, and sometimes did things or were capable of things I didn't understand. Why does Alina, on page 200, suddenly cite an "inner cartographer" when cartography doesn't affect anything but her description of a single room? How do Mal's tracking skills lead to him being able to track what should have been a mythical creature, in an environment he's presumably never been in before? Why is he capable of such observance that he can track animals, but can't parse Alina's secrets, despite being her childhood friend? Why does Genya stay with the Darkling in the beginning, instead of fleeing?</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Speaking of Genya, when she re-appears later in the story, mutilated, what is it supposed to accomplish? It isn't to show that the Darkling is evil — we already know that — he's murdered people and blinded his own mother. Did the Darkling torture Genya for fun? Did he do it because Genya tried to fight him or escape? Did he do it just to bother Alina? The treatment of Genya in particular sickens me, because it accomplishes nothing significant story-wise, and is violent. It reeks of <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Women_in_refrigerators">fridging</a> (even though Alina, the protagonist, is female), especially since it was hinted that Genya was sexually assaulted in the first book.</div><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1">Genya is a flat character; she exists in <i>Siege</i>&nbsp;to be beautiful and then to be "ruined" for no given reason, so harshly that Alina finally develops into someone ruthless. Alina snaps not when she learns thousands have lost their lives to the Darkling and his actions, and not when she learns Ravka's monarchy is incompetent at best and cruel at worst — she snaps when she learns that there are peasants who call Genya "The Ruined." Alina thereafter orders repeat offenders to have their tongues cut out.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Maybe the reason why Genya is Alina's breaking point is because the Darkling's actions are finally personal to Alina now, but even so, I don't feel that I have enough of a grasp on Alina's motivations and feelings to understand how Genya in particular affected her. Throughout the book Alina cites her desire to save her country, to prevent unnecessary deaths; but the deaths of anonymous villagers and even of almost all of the Grisha don't move her the same way Genya's mutilation does. Alina's overall motivations through the book feel hand-waved. Why does she want to save Ravka? Just Because? What has it ever done for her?</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">The world-building felt especially messy. Both the sea whip and the firebird are creatures that are supposedly famous and well-told in Ravkan stories, but we never hear these stories being told. It's tough to feel that either are so notorious or venerable without evidence, though I would have really enjoyed reading about them if they had been alluded to more in the first book. I'm also still not clear on what exactly "sun summoning" is, and since there's a lot made of how Ravka's canon magic "only messes with what exists, and doesn't create anything new from nothing" I'm not sure how Alina can just summon light out of nowhere in the first place.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">I'm also not a fan of the Russian (Russian-esque?) words thrown into the book at various places. I'm not sure what they're supposed to accomplish. A sense of exoticism? Why are some words italicized and some not, like "Etherealki" versus "<i>grenatki,</i>" or "samovar" versus "<i>kvas</i>"? The flavor is too inconsistent — and for me, too meaningless — to enjoy.</div><br /><div class="p2">Though I still didn't find many reasons to like Mal, I <i>really </i>enjoyed reading about<i>&nbsp;Siege</i>'s&nbsp;newest character, Nikolai, to extent that I wished that the entire book was about him instead, haha. Nikolai, a rebellious privateer prince who desperately cares for others and deeply understands human nature, is way more compelling than another naturally handsome teenage peasant whose biggest problem is his commoner's bloodline. Bardugo's dialogue in general also has Whedon-esque punchyquipness and I loved reading it.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p2">For the third book: I'm excited to see what reasons the Darkling had to commit all the atrocities he did. I really am! I also hoped Nikolai survived. <i>Please. Think of the quips!</i></div></div>

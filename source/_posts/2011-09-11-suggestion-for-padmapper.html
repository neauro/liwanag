Then, along with the <a href="http://www.walkscore.com/">Walkscore</a> and Street View of an individual listing, you could see how long it takes to get to these locations via nearby bus lines.  I'm finding myself making sure that locations on Padmapper are near bus lines by typing in addresses into Google Maps, and I did this too when trying to find a place to live in San Francisco this summer.<br /><br />Actually, even listing "nearby bus lines" would just be helpful.  (Though not as helpful if you're not familiar with a city's public transportation, as was the case with me, SF, and BART.)<br /><br />That being said, using Padmapper thus far instead of just scrolling text ads on Craigslist has made apartment hunting a little more fun.  But it may be because I have a fondness of maps in general.</div>

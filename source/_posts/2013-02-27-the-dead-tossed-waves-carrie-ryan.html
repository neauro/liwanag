She's content to let her friends dream of the Dark City up the coast while she watches from the top of her lighthouse. Home is all she's ever known, and all she needs for happiness. <br /><br />But life after the Return is never safe, and there are threats even the Barrier can't hold back. <br /><br />Gabry's mother thought she left her secrets behind in the Forest of Hands and Teeth, but like the dead in their world, secrets don't stay buried. And now, Gabry's world is crumbling. <br /><br />One night beyond the Barrier... <br /><br />One boy Gabry's known forever and one veiled in mystery... <br /><br />One reckless moment, and half of Gabry's generation is dead, the other half imprisoned.<br /><br />Gabry knows only one thing: if she is to have any hope of a future, she must face the forest of her mother's past. </em></blockquote><br />[ spoilers ]<br /><br />I read <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2012/12/the-forest-of-hands-and-teeth-carrie.html">The Forest of Hands and Teeth</a>&nbsp;and borrowed the sequel from Andou's teenage sister and ended up skimming the latter half. Gabry spends every third page bemoaning the paths in her life that took or didn't take or maybe will or will not take in the future, and occasionally is angry about things that I can't understand her being angry about. Why did it upset her to learn she was adopted? Did she ever have a particular love for truth? Maybe if part of her was all about <i>rules</i>&nbsp;and <i>keeping things in order and organized </i>because this is how people need to survive in the world, and having all these things break apart in front of her was too much for her to handle?<br /><br />Gabry's story also feels like a rehash of her mother's. There are two boys to act as love interests and guardians, one best friend who repudiates her, a lot of body heat and soft lips and unexpected clutching.<br /><br />One thing I will say: that one giant chasm in the end filled with the undead was pretty cool.</div>

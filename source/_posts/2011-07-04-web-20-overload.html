<div class='post'>
San Francisco has been great!  I've been spending most of the time trying to get acclimated to my work environment/coworkers, as well as to the passersby here, who all say "Hi" at the last possible moment.  I end up turning around hastily and yelling "Hi!" to their backs.<br /><br />I've come to an uncomfortable point in my life where I have so many Web 2.0 things that I have no idea what to update, when I feel like updating something.  Most of my SF adventures are detailed on <a href="http://neauro.tumblr.com/tagged/one_new_sf_thing_every_day">my Tumblr</a>, where I strive to do "one new thing a day." My reasoning for not putting that sort of stuff here is that, the stuff I put on Tumblr is more personal?  And I would prefer to reserve this blog for stuff of more professional nature, i.e. learning about programming?  There's also a different flavor to how things get shared on Tumblr that I'm mindful of, for example, if I'm uploading pictures, all the ones of dessert go to Tumblr, whereas all my super-nicer ones (even if they include family) all go to Flickr, and everything may go indiscriminately to Facebook, etc.<br /><br />I guess on the topic of learning new things, I've been trying to revamp my portfolio website, but been having fun just changing things here and there, searching for the right layout.  I'm trying to learn Sinatra and it's going well, but since my Dreamhost account doesn't really support Rails, I may have to do the site in PHP anyway if I want to get it up faster, and try using Heroku if I'd be okay with getting it up later.</div>

Real Talk: This is the only thing I cooked for myself all summer.  <br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7GIhwYehhS8/TmQ2ci9SAvI/AAAAAAAAAaU/pNSCc61AZNY/s1600/DSC_0004.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7GIhwYehhS8/TmQ2ci9SAvI/AAAAAAAAAaU/pNSCc61AZNY/s640/DSC_0004.JPG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">dat ingredients</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><br /></h3><h3>   Ingredients</h3><ul><li>1 Russet Potato</li><li>2 broccoli florets</li><li>4 white mushrooms</li><li>some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarlsberg_cheese">Jarlsberg cheese</a></li><li>pinches of rosemary, ground seasalt</li></ul><i>Serves 1</i> (though to be honest, I'm always overly full when I finish, so you could probably split it)<br /><br /><br /><h3>   Instructions</h3><ol><li><strong>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.</strong></li><li><strong>Wash the potato, stab it all around with a fork, and then stick it in the oven.</strong> If you do not stab your potato with a fork or knife, it will explode.</li><li><strong>Wash everything and then begin cutting it up.</strong> Mushrooms I tend to mince, and for broccoli I tear up the florets by hand.  I don't usually like the stem (despite it actually being sweeter than the florets), but it's easier for me to eat if I cut it up into small pieces.  Might as well use all the pounds you paid for, right?  <em>Fun Fact</em>: I can't find evidence of this now, but my old cooking teacher told me that it's better to tear broccoli rather than cut it.  <em>Fun Fact #2:</em> We're not using it here, but this reminds me that I read garlic yields more of its nutrients to you if you mince it than if you leave it in chunks.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NyHRsjf7lK8/TmRDSVyzoZI/AAAAAAAAAac/W3g6kW8Idtg/s1600/DSC_0011.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NyHRsjf7lK8/TmRDSVyzoZI/AAAAAAAAAac/W3g6kW8Idtg/s640/DSC_0011.JPG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i always really liked the cross-sections of mushrooms and broccoli stems</td></tr></tbody></table><br /></li><li><strong>Once the potato has been in for around 30 minutes, throw the broccoli into a pot of water and start bringing it to a boil.</strong> Once it starts boiling, turn the heat down low or turn it off completely and let it drain in a colander.  This is to prevent the broccoli from becoming over-cooked and leaking all its nutrients into the water besides.  (It's probably better to steam it, but I don't have a steamer and am always too lazy to look up hacky ways to steam.) The florets can hold a lot of water, so make sure you press out all the moisture either now or as you're eating so that stuff doesn't get soggy.</li><li><strong>Around this time, I also start frying the mushrooms.</strong> Specifically, I do it with Trader Joe's Spanish Olive Oil, and sprinkle on rosemary and freshly ground seasalt.  Why freshly ground seasalt?  Because when I searched the cabinets of the place I'm subletting, all I could find was a canister of large seasalt grains and a porcelain mortar and pestle.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1OOtVvICJ0k/TmRDeL7IcuI/AAAAAAAAAak/JCfADhKtSGQ/s1600/DSC_0013.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1OOtVvICJ0k/TmRDeL7IcuI/AAAAAAAAAak/JCfADhKtSGQ/s640/DSC_0013.JPG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">i wonder if it really makes the salt taste better</td></tr></tbody></table><br /></li><li><strong>Once the mushrooms start looking pretty cooked, turn down the heat.</strong> It'll depend on you how cooked you want the mushrooms to be, though I generally like them pretty brown myself.  I wouldn't be frying them for more than 10 minutes or so.</li><li><strong>Once the potato has been in the oven for an hour and a half to two hours, take it out.</strong> I generally err on the side of waiting longer for the potato, since I love it when they're soft and mushy on the inside.  Plus this makes the skin crispier!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4mp2iXyqTUQ/TmRDmSqMVwI/AAAAAAAAAas/fzKhIbIkjVg/s1600/DSC_0014.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="426" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4mp2iXyqTUQ/TmRDmSqMVwI/AAAAAAAAAas/fzKhIbIkjVg/s640/DSC_0014.JPG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">an armor of crunchy deliciousness</td></tr></tbody></table></li></ol><br /><br /><h3>   How to Eat</h3>I generally slice the potato in half, put in liberal amounts of minced Jarlsberg, and then hold the potato closed so that it will all melt into gooey deliciousness.  Then, eat with the mushrooms and broccoli in whatever proportions you desire. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-f2IrirrJ0Sc/TmRIoWdiXTI/AAAAAAAAAa4/KDNnnbwFibM/s1600/DSC_0015.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="424" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-f2IrirrJ0Sc/TmRIoWdiXTI/AAAAAAAAAa4/KDNnnbwFibM/s640/DSC_0015.JPG" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">mmmmmmmmm</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><h3>   Cost</h3>Laziness always brings me to the closest grocery for ingredients, which happens to be Whole Foods.  This is how much I spent at my last visit today: <br /><ul><li>White mushrooms, 0.40 lb at 3.99/lb -- $1.60</li><li>Broccoli crowns, 1.02 lb at 2.99/lb -- $3.06</li><li>Russet potato, 1.46 lb at 1.99/lb -- $2.91</li><li>Jarlsberg -- $4.00</li><li><strong>Total: ~$11.57</strong></li></ul><br />Everything was organic and thus more expensive, but this sort of stuff always makes me aware that "eating healthy" can really be a class issue.  I'm not saying that this is the healthiest meal on the planet, but it's probably better than a McDonalds dinner, with a trade-off that it's more expensive money-wise and time-wise.  I'm privileged in that I don't work so hard each day that it's difficult for me to find time to cook, much less find time to cook for myself <em>and</em> a family.  I mean, come on guys.  $8 for two potatoes, 5 mushrooms, and 3 broccoli crowns?</div>

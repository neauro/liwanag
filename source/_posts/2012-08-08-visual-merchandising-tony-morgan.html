Using examples from a range of stores from fashion emporia to supermarkets, the book offers practical advice on the subject, supported by hints and tips from established visual merchandisers. It reveals the secrets of their tool kit, and information on the use of mannequins, the latest technology, how to construct and source props, and explains the psychology behind shopping and buyer behavior. </i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Presented through color photographs, diagrams of floor layouts, and store case studies, and including invaluable information such as a glossary of terms used in the industry, Visual Merchandising is an essential handbook for anyone working in and learning about this exciting area.</i></blockquote><br />This came up as a hit when I searched the public library database for books about stores and merchandising, which I was in turn searching for as a resource for free-to-play game design. <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/06/11/154787321/game-maker-stunted-by-facebook-turns-to-mobile">As NPR uncovered</a>, free-to-play games are a lot like stores; you see the nice displays outside, shuffle in and around for a while, and if you discover something that you like, something that will, perhaps, make you feel like a better human being, you pay money to obtain that thing.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.electricrest.com/wordpress/?p=376">Electric Rest</a> details some other possible applications of store design to free-to-play games, and I thought I would try and find some myself.&nbsp;<i>Visual Merchandising </i>turns out to be something of a beautiful textbook, with a history of window displays that in Olden Times (a.k.a. early 1900s) displayed not fashionable&nbsp;manikins, but rotating displays of art and sometimes curiosities (like a plane that had fallen while attempting to cross the Atlantic, and was promptly reassembled in a department store window).<br /><br />With regards to a digital medium, the takeaways are a little harder to come by, though I guess you could force them out. For example, indoor arrangements depend on the store's architecture, but there are a couple rules of thumb that help, such as "shelves that are angled rather than parallel to each other can draw people in to explore." Could an interface be designed in such a way that the eye is drawn to viewing other goods for sale, rather than relying on a "Go to next page" click? How could you fashion an experience that allows someone to wander aimlessly, yet also not impede them if they want to get directly to Point B?<br /><br />The three-dimensional space and atmosphere afforded by a store can be impactful in ways that I think are hard to mirror to video games, or even shopping websites. There's the three-dimensionality, of course, and the impact of sound and other people and smells set to artificially make you feel like you're in a warm tropical clothing paradise ripe for bikini buying. Also, even though I'm sure people are aware of the fact that stores try and push cheap gum and parcels of assorted high fructose corn syrup at you as you're paying for your Actual Purchases, I think it's easy to write off a lot of store design as "Oh, they did that just because that's the way the store is shaped, not because they're <i>trying&nbsp;desperately to sink their hands into my wallet.</i>" Contrast to perpetual social game pop-ups rewarding you with discounts on virtual goods.<br /><br />Another thing that&nbsp;I believe stores will have going for them for a while is their ability to support social exploration, to serve as a bauble-filled backdrop to people's wanderings as they share each other's company. I can't think of any games that do similar. (Though I suddenly imagine some WoW- or Second Life-esque scenario...ah, well, you could imagine an MMORPG fitting into <i>any</i> scenario, though.)<br /><br />In short: <i>Visual Merchandising</i> has gorgeous photos, some interesting history and details about things like department stores and manikins, and so on. It also features some ~*famous window displays*~ like the one from Selfridge's which has all those inflatable boobs...what does it look like?

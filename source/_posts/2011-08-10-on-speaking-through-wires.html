It was for a position that I felt was made for me -- involving writing, drawing, design, some management too.  (Managing soothes me because I feel like I have an eye on everything that's going on.) Despite my enthusiasm I think I still wasn't able to explain myself properly, and I blame it in some part on Skype.  I struggle with communicating effectively over electronic things like phones and video-chats.  People's eyes don't meet, there are no visual cues, they don't see that I'm fiddling with the cork of this delicious Cupcake Red Velvet wine that I finished yesterday as I think.<br /><br />The internet connection is faulty.  Did they understand what I said?  Did I really understand what they said?  Am I being too silly?  <em>Are my feelings of pure love for video game design and story reaching you through these pixels?</em><br /><br />Man, I love the comfort of words that you can think through before you write, then think through after you write, then revise if necessary.<br /><br />One thing they asked was for further demonstration of my ability to sketch things out in perspective, or make layouts, so after RPG today (every Tuesday with the other interns) I drew out a short rendition of Little Red Riding Hood, the whole of which you can view <a href="http://neauro.tumblr.com/post/8727734003/sf-day-43-mondays-man-sf-day-44-had-an">on Tumblr</a>, where it looks much prettier, thanks to the whole <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/08/good-design-moves-tumblr-has-made.html">tiled photosets</a> thing.<br /><br />I don't think I've drawn things "with perspective" since the endless corridors of elementary school, but these were fun to do. :)</div>

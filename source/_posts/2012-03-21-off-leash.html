<div class='post'>
is the cutest dog-based tilt runner game that I've ever played, despite being a game in which it is difficult to play and get a screenshot which captures the excitement of running full tilt (ohoho) with a growing pack of thickly-lined canines. I only wish that there was a shiba inu, but then, I always wish this for everything, even things that don't necessarily include dogs in the first place.<br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Mixvu6hl3zE/T2ovQKb4dkI/AAAAAAAAAr8/-lPWr3xePpg/s640/blogger-image-1447569057.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Mixvu6hl3zE/T2ovQKb4dkI/AAAAAAAAAr8/-lPWr3xePpg/s640/blogger-image-1447569057.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">screenshot of "off the leash"</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It's free to play, with purchaseable items being more (non-shiba) dogs, power-ups, and even a permanent "2x coin bonus" thing for 99 cents. &nbsp;At some point I unlocked "Tiki Surf Hut Bonus Thing Level" and searched around for it in vain, only to realize that its appearance would be a semi-random in-game&nbsp;occurrence, not something that I could summon at will from the main menu. &nbsp;Was this an example of "verbal, unexpected, informational feedback" that is so beloved of games that hold high the ideal of <a href="http://chrishecker.com/Achievements_Considered_Harmful%3F">instrinsic motivation</a>? &nbsp;Or maybe just UI that wasn't clear enough in informing me that it would reward me with such a bonus level after collecting X amount of steaks and Y number of dalmations during play? &nbsp;The world may never know.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-O6CiUATBERg/T2y5EYdhSiI/AAAAAAAAAsY/EdzBFRxnA_A/s1600/blogger-image-1979466662.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-O6CiUATBERg/T2y5EYdhSiI/AAAAAAAAAsY/EdzBFRxnA_A/s320/blogger-image-1979466662.jpg" width="213" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">the crash of 38 dogs</td></tr></tbody></table></div>

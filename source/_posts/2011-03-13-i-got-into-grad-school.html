And even when I received the confirming e-mail, I honestly didn't think that it was that big of a deal.  No one ever talked to me about grad school — not my parents — I didn't really get what the difference was between an MS and a PHD until a month ago.  It was only ever seriously mentioned to me by my high school computer science teacher, and even then I don't think he meant for me to pursue HCDE/HCI/H-etc., which, despite my great interest in it, still seems to me to be a sort of "liberal artsy" type of study, and therefore somehow not as prestigious as something mathy or sciencey.  (No offense to any liberal artsy folk — after all, I am one of you at heart — and surely you must know too, the feeling of somehow being <em>wrong</em> because it seems like <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2009-11-23/politics/obama.science_1_science-education-math-and-science-president-obama?_s=PM:POLITICS">even the president disapproves of you</a>.)<br /><br />In any case.  I am happy that I'm working on a degree in computer science, but the fact is that I really feel like I just haven't...felt like I've learned everything that I wanted to.  I feel like I've spent most of my undergrad years half-asleep at the wheel, and now I've only just woken up and realized that I can do <em>other things</em>, I can stretch beyond given assignments, I can apply for jobs and pick myself up if it doesn't work out.  And that's why I went after the Master's, mostly: because I've really liked what little I've learned about design, because I want more reasons to stay in Seattle, because I still want to be a student, because I was cruising Bungie's site and it had one position I was interested in, and for this position they were hiring people <em>with advanced education in HCI or related fields</em>.<br /><br />Today I broke the news to Alex and he hugged me super tightly, the same way Mariko and Leilani did, and he congratulated me like Andreas and even his parents did, and I started to feel like, <em>Wait.<br /><br />Is this more important than I think it is?  What have I gotten myself into?</em><br /><br />I am looking forward to it, though.  I hope that when I arrive at that first class, when I get my first homework assignment, that I feel like it's a delight to do and not a chore.  What a novel thing, to be so excited about studying.</div>

Last Tuesday was day two of the <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/search/label/pscs">game design class</a> I'm facilitating at <a href="http://pscs.org/">PSCS</a>. Having no experience teaching game design, it's mostly an experiment, an exercise in semi-public speaking, and a way for me to talk more about game design, which I really like.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Yc0bvPPVwkE/TxJ3WaiffmI/AAAAAAAAAmk/xQZlYahQ7zg/s1600/five5.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="322" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Yc0bvPPVwkE/TxJ3WaiffmI/AAAAAAAAAmk/xQZlYahQ7zg/s640/five5.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">screenshot of <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/586264">five/5</a></td></tr></tbody></table><br />Last week I had the students watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAoW9fjKmo4">Wolfire's design critique of World of Goo</a>, and then assigned everybody (including myself) to play ()<a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/586264">Five/5</a>, a game we chose at random from the front page of Newgrounds. We were all going to return and talk about it, and these were the major points we came up with about the game:<br /><br /><ul><li>the graphics and sound are nice</li><li>the mechanic was fun to figure out and work with</li><li>except the part where the background patterns (varied, moving, and eye-catching) mislead you in thinking they're relevant, which they aren't, in that some of us were able to finish without giving them a second thought</li><li>and, there was also a pretty high uncertainty about whether the game was fundamentally buggy.</li></ul><br />Apparently, even after thinking they're uncovered the secret of the continuity mechanism, there were still times in which two pieces of perfectly-fitting-together map did not allow free passage between them. &nbsp;This suggests the game may have fared better with a little more feedback; that is, if it had somehow told you when you were doing things wrong (maybe by flashing that nice background), maybe you would be able to differentiate between when you were doing something wrong, or when you were doing something right and the game was messing up (unless the game was <i>really</i>&nbsp;buggy).<br /><br />The main idea I wanted to discuss this time was that you need to design for your players, so I also had them take the <a href="http://survey.ihobo.com/BrainHex/">Brainhex</a>&nbsp;questionnaire for funsies to see what type of gamer they were. &nbsp;Apparently this class is chock full of Mastermind/Conqueror/Achiever types, but someone pointed out quickly that they felt more like a Seeker, and we made a disassociation between identities and behaviors (i.e. it's more important to design for an "Achiever behavior" rather than "an Achiever person," since everyone may want different things at different times). &nbsp;We talked about AI difficulty and what types of behaviors it might please or not. &nbsp;For example, an AI in a racing game which slows down or speeds up depending on how well or poorly a player is doing would help a novice player because they wouldn't feel so strongly the sting of defeat. &nbsp;Someone with Conqueror behavior, however, who loves epic wins, would find an AI that sticks close to her back bumper frustrating -- she would only ever win by a hair. &nbsp;(I got this example from a website whose link I've misplaced, but I'll credit it soon.)<br /><br />I also talked about PhotoCity (of course!) and the unexpected behaviors that may occur from players. &nbsp;Our game meant for casual crowdsourcing, became instead a tool for the hardcore player way into 3d building reconstruction. &nbsp;The "playtest" took the game to a place way different than we expected! &nbsp;Whoa! &nbsp;See all the amazing things that can happen after playtesting?<br /><br />At some point I ran out of things to talk about and had some minutes left so I talked about tutorials, heavily referencing <a href="http://www.auntiepixelante.com/?p=465">this</a>&nbsp;cool article. &nbsp;I first asked what the students knew about tutorials and they explained they didn't have much need of them, since they already knew how to play games for the most part; when they got to a new one, they just clicked through.<br /><br />Me: "Well, there had to be a time when you <i>didn't</i>&nbsp;know how to play games already. &nbsp;What was the first game you played?"<br /><br />One of them: "I think...yeah, it was Grand Theft Auto 3."<br /><br />Oh...oh.<br /><br />"Haven't you guys ever played Mario?!"<br /><br />"A little," they admitted. &nbsp;"I haven't beaten it."<br /><br />I drew the first level of Mario on the board anyway and talked a little, and before I knew it, class was up.<br /><br />I still feel weird about this -- I feel simultaneously like there's not enough to talk about, or not enough interesting things to talk about which don't involve flashing lights and nice graphics, which is untrue. &nbsp;At the same time, rather than talk about articles and writing, I wish that I could teach them about paper prototyping, or really try and design a game out that they could program. &nbsp;But I guess an hour a week for nine weeks has its limitations, and it's good to start somewhere.</div>

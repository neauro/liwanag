After reading of a case in which <A href="http://rosalarian.tumblr.com/post/66303922266/alexds1-alexheberling-encik-farhan-is-a">a Kickstarter backer scammed dozens of artists</a>, one phrase stuck out to me. The phrase isn't in that link, and unfortunately, I can't find it in any others, but it goes something like: <em>[The scammer] doesn't give them any money, and gets to have all these projects shown on his profile</em>.

It made me realize Kickstarter's profiles worth looking at as a thing that people can actually be proud of. That appeal to a persons's sense of progress, and the desire to gather things. The little pie chat, especially, could be an example of <a href="http://www.psychologyofgames.com/2010/11/endowed-progress-effect-and-game-quests/">endowed progress</a>. Even if there's nothing necessarily telling you, "Go fill in your pie chart!" the fact that it's *there*, and it's *incomplete*...

Well, I feel compelled to fill it up. But I'm also the type of person that restarted my Metroid Prime save file when I realized I missed scanning the first boss.

Kickstarter also offers some encouragement when you click the empty slice of your pie chart.

<p class="caption">"Let's change that!"</a></p>

It's pretty cute that the slices are all (presumably) different colors, and I'm really tempted to fill them in with $1 pledges to relevant projects. I wonder how Kickstarter encourages users to back more projects if they have filled in all their slices?

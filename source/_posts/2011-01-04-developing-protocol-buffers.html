Again taken from <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/docs/overview.html">t3h googs</a>, who developed protocol buffers in the first place.<br /><br /><br /><span class="sig">What are protocol buffers?</span><br />Protocol buffers are a "flexible, efficient, automated mechanism for serializing structured data" -- like XML but smaller, faster, simpler.  In this case, I assume that "serializing data" refers to converting some data structure into an object that can be stored and then unpacked again into another computer environment, i.e. storing a list into a file or something so it can be sent over a network and then opened up again and read by someone else.  So, a protocol buffer provides a way for data to be moved across multiple computers, which explains why it's relevant to <a href="http://nuubu.blogspot.com/2011/01/intro-to-distributed-systems.html">distributed systems</a>.<br /><br /><br /><span class="sig">How do protocol buffers work?</span><br />You have data, and you want to serialize it so that you can trasmit it to another network or computer in a message.  To specify how you want to serialize it, you have to <strong>define protocol buffer message types in <code>.proto</code> files</strong>.  Each protocol buffer message is a small, logical record of information with a series of name-value pairs.  A <code>.proto</code> file which defines a message containing information about a Pokemon would be like this:<br /><br /><pre class="brush: js">message Pokemon {<br />    required string species = 1;<br />    required int32 id = 2;<br />    optional string trainer = 3;<br />    optional string nickname = 4;<br /><br />    enum Type1 {<br />        FIRE = 0;<br />        WATER = 1;<br />        GRASS = 2;<br />    }<br />}       <br /></pre><br />So in this case, I've got a message that serializes data about a Pokemon.  The message contains information about a Pokemon, its trainer, its id, its nickname, and its type.  For a message to be a well-formed Pokemon message, it must contain exactly one of <code>species</code> and <code>id</code>, but can have zero or exactly one of <code>trainer</code> or <code>nickname</code>.  The <code>enum</code> means that the Pokemon will have only one of a predefined list of values -- that is, only one type out of the three given types.<br /><br />Once the messages have been defined, they're run against whatever protocol buffer compiler you have for your application's language, which will generate <strong>data access classes</strong>.  These will provide a way to access each field defined in the message.  So, if you were using C++, the data access class created would be called <code>Pokemon</code>, and you could then use this <code>Pokemon</code> class to populate, serialize, and retrieve <code>Pokemon</code> protocol buffer messages.  Then you send out the message like,<br /><br /><pre class="brush:cpp">Pokemon pokemon;<br />pokemon.set_species("Charmander");<br />pokemon.set_id(4);<br />pokemon.set_trainer("Red");<br />fstream output("file", ios::out | ios::binary);<br />pokemon.SerializeToOsteam(&amp;output);<br /></pre><br />and read it like,<br /><br /><pre class="brush:cpp">fstream input("file", ios::in | ios:: binary);<br />Pokemon pokemon;<br />pokemon.ParseFromIsteam(&amp;input);<br />cout &lt;&lt; "Pokemon: " &lt;&lt; pokemon.species() &lt;&lt; endl;<br />cout &lt;&lt; "Trainer: " &lt;&lt; pokemon.trainer() &lt;&lt; endl;<br /></pre><br /><span class="sig">What are the advantages of protocol buffers?</span><br /><ul><li>You can add new fields to message formats without breaking backwards-compatibility; old binaries will just ignore the new field.  So, extending the protocol is simple, and you can do it without having to worry about breaking existing code.</li><li>It's simpler, smaller, faster, and less ambiguous than XML.  Plus, it generates the data access classes, which are easier to use in programs.  I imagine that XML takes so much space and is harder to parse because you have to close tags.  Also, to manipulate XML you'd have to do things like finding a node "species" and then accessing its inner text, instead of just retrieving "species" immediately.</li></ul><br />Sources:<br /><a href="http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/docs/overview.html">Google: Protocol Buffers Developer Guide</a><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialize">Wikipedia: Serialization</a><br /><a href="http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/docs/proto.html#enum">Google: Protocol Buffers Language Guide</a></div>
